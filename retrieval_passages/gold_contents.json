However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information.

Therefore we care about intent prediction for the generated system response. Since our baselines are more suited for social chat as they cannot produce system intents, we use the system intent and slot classifiers trained in our model to predict their responses' intents and slots. The intent predictor achieves a $84\\%$ accuracy and the semantic slot predictor achieves $77\\%$ on the AntiScam dataset.

The task becomes even harder if we attempt to perform rumour detection on-the-fly, without looking into the future. We provide an effective and highly scalable approach to detect rumours instantly after they were posted with zero delay. We introduce a new features category called novelty based features. Novelty based features compensate the absence of repeated information by consulting additional data sources - news wire articles. We hypothesize that information not confirmed by official news is an indication of rumours. Additionally we introduce pseudo feedback for classification. In a nutshell, documents that are similar to previously detected rumours are considered to be more likely to also be a rumour. The proposed features can be computed in constant time and space allowing us to process high-volume streams in real-time (Muthukrishnan, 2005). Our experiments reveal that novelty based features and pseudo feedback significantly increases detection performance for early rumour detection."

In contrast to traditional news wire, information on social media is spread without intensive investigation, fact and background checking. The combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours, false- and disinformation. Social media users tend to share controversial information in-order to verify it, while asking about for the opinions of their followers (Zhao et. al, 2015).

Unfortunately, the currently most successful features rely on information based on graph propagation and clustering, which can only be computed retrospectively. This renders them close to useless when detecting rumours early on. We introduce two new classes of features, one based on novelty, the other on pseudo feedback. Both feature categories improve detection accuracy early on, when information is limited."

            "In this thesis proposal, I will present KALM BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , a system for knowledge authoring and question answering. KALM is superior to the current CNL systems in that KALM has a complex frame-semantic parser which can standardize the semantics of the sentences that express the same meaning via different linguistic structures. The frame-semantic parser is built based on FrameNet BIBREF7 and BabelNet BIBREF8 where FrameNet is used to capture the meaning of the sentence and BabelNet BIBREF8 is used to disambiguate the meaning of the extracted entities from the sentence. Experiment results show that KALM achieves superior accuracy in knowledge authoring and question answering as compared to the state-of-the-art systems.",
            "This section provides a summary of the evaluation of KALM and KALM-QA, where KALM is evaluated for knowledge authoring and KALM-QA is evaluated for question answering. We have created a total of 50 logical frames, mostly derived from FrameNet but also some that FrameNet is missing (like Restaurant, Human_Gender) for representing the meaning of English sentences. Based on the 50 frames, we have manually constructed 250 sentences that are adapted from FrameNet exemplar sentences and evaluate these sentences on KALM, SEMAFOR, SLING, and Stanford KBP system. KALM achieves an accuracy of 95.6%\u2014much higher than the other systems."

Let $f_i$ represent the likelihood of $i$ appearing when discussing women or men. $f_i$ is unknown, but we can model the distribution of all possible $f_i$ using the corpus of texts that we have from the domain. We construct a gender-balanced version of the corpus by randomly undersampling the more prevalent gender until the proportions of each gender are equal. Assuming a non-informative prior distribution on $f_i$, the posterior distribution is Beta($k_i$, $N - k_i$), where $k_i$ is the count of $i$ in the gender-balanced corpus and $N$ is the total count of words in that corpus.",

The intuition is that if the cluster is coherent, then an observer should be able to identify the out-of-cluster word as the intruder. For both domains, we report results on all clusters and on the top 8, ranked by ascending normalized sum of squared errors, which can be seen as a prediction of coherence. In the celebrity domain, annotators identified the out-of-cluster word 73% of the time in the top-8 and 53% overall. In the professor domain, annotators identified it 60% of the time in the top-8 and 49% overall. As expected, top-8 performance in both domains does considerably better than overall, but at all levels the precision is significantly above the random baseline of 20%.",

The latter extends the Swivel algorithm BIBREF20 to jointly learn word, lemma and concept embeddings on a corpus disambiguated against the KG, outperforming the previous state of the art in word and word-sense embeddings by co-training word, lemma and concept embeddings as opposed to training each individually. In contrast to Vecsigrafo, which requires both a text corpus and a KG, HolE follows a graph-based approach where embeddings are learnt exclusively from the KG. As section SECREF14 will show, this gives Vecsigrafo a certain advantage in the FCC task. Following up with the work presented in BIBREF16, our experiments focus on Sensigrafo, the KG underlying Expert System's Cogito NLP proprietary platform. Similar to WordNet, on which Vecsigrafo has also been successfully trained, Sensigrafo is a general-purpose KG with lexical and semantic information that contains over 300K concepts, 400K lemmas and 80 types of relations rendering 3M links. We use Cogito to disambiguate the text corpora prior to training Vecsigrafo. All the semantic (lemma and concept) embeddings produced with HolE or Vecsigrafo are 100-D.",

Deeper inspection shows that HolE only covers 20% of the lemmas in the SciGraph vocabulary.

In this paper we describe our system designed for the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity, which we tackle based on the premise of representation learning without the usage of external information, such as lexicons.

Table TABREF20 shows there are fewer tweets targeting disability in Arabic compared to English and French and no tweets insulting people based on their sexual orientation which may be due to the fact that the labels of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation use almost the same wording.

We also provided the annotators with a category to cover hate directed towards one individual, which cannot be generalized. In case the tweet targets more than one group of people, the annotators should choose the group which would be the most affected by it according to them. Table TABREF10 shows the counts of the five categories out of 16 that commonly occur in the three languages. In fact, most of the tweets target individuals or fall into the \u201cother\u201d category. In the latter case, they may target people with different political views such as liberals or conservatives in English and French, or specific ethnic groups such as Kurdish people in Arabic. English tweets tend to have more tweets targeting people with special needs, due to common language-specific demeaning terms used in conversations where people insult one another. Arabic tweets contain more hateful comments towards women for the same reason.

            "On the other hand, there is also a syntactic disambiguation problem which as yet lacks good solutions. For instance, the English language contains irregular verbs like \u201cset\u201d or \u201cput\u201d. Depending on the structure of a sentence, it is not possible to recognize their verbal tense, e.g., present or past tense. Even statistical approaches trained on huge corpora may fail to find the exact meaning of some words due to the structure of the language. Although this challenge has successfully been dealt with since NMT has been used for European languages, implementations of NMT for some non-European languages have not been fully exploited (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese, Latin-America Spanish, Zulu, Hindi) due to the lack of large bilingual data sets on the Web to be trained on. Thus, we suggest gathering relationships among properties within an ontology by using the reasoning technique for handling this issue. For instance, the sentence \u201cAnna usually put her notebook on the table for studying\" may be annotated using a certain vocabulary and represented by triples. Thus, the verb \u201cput\", which is represented by a predicate that groups essential information about the verbal tense, may support the generation step of a given MT system. This sentence usually fails when translated to rich morphological languages, such as Brazilian-Portuguese and Arabic, for which the verb influences the translation of \u201cusually\" to the past tense. In this case, a reasoning technique may support the problem of finding a certain rule behind relationships between source and target texts in the alignment phase (training phase). However, a well-known problem of reasoners is the poor run-time performance. Therefore, this run-time deficiency needs to be addressed or minimized before implementing reasoners successfully into MT systems.",

            "Although MT systems are now popular on the Web, they still generate a large number of incorrect translations. Recently, Popovi\u0107 BIBREF3 has classified five types of errors that still remain in MT systems. According to research, the two main faults that are responsible for 40% and 30% of problems respectively, are reordering errors and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. Thus, addressing these barriers is a key challenge for modern translation systems. A large number of MT approaches have been developed over the years that could potentially serve as a remedy. For instance, translators began by using methodologies based on linguistics which led to the family of RBMT. However, RBMT systems have a critical drawback in their reliance on manually crafted rules, thus making the development of new translation modules for different languages even more difficult."

            "SW has already shown its capability for semantic disambiguation of polysemous and homonymous words. However, SWT were applied in two ways to support the semantic disambiguation in MT. First, the ambiguous words were recognized in the source text before carrying out the translation, applying a pre-editing technique. Second, SWT were applied to the output translation in the target language as a post-editing technique. Although applying one of these techniques has increased the quality of a translation, both techniques are tedious to implement when they have to translate common words instead of named entities, then be applied several times to achieve a successful translation."

            "(1) Excessive focus on English and European languages as one of the involved languages in MT approaches and poor research on low-resource language pairs such as African and/or South American languages. (2) The limitations of SMT approaches for translating across domains. Most MT systems exhibit good performance on law and the legislative domains due to the large amount of data provided by the European Union. In contrast, translations performed on sports and life-hacks commonly fail, because of the lack of training data. (3) How to translate the huge amount of data from social networks that uniquely deal with no-standard speech texts from users (e.g., tweets). (4) The difficult translations among morphologically rich languages. This challenge shares the same problem with the first one, namely that most research work focuses on English as one of the involved languages. Therefore, MT systems which translate content between, for instance, Arabic and Spanish are rare. (5) For the speech translation task, the parallel data for training differs widely from real user speech."

Making sense of how diagrams exploit the 2D layout space falls arguably within the domain of computer vision. On the other hand, diagrams also have a discourse structure, which uses the layout space to set up discourse relations between instances of natural language, various types of images, arrows and lines, thus forming a unified discourse organisation.

            "Controversy detection is a difficult task because 1) controversies are latent, like ideology, meaning they are often not directly mentioned as controversial in text. 2) Controversies occur across a vast range of topics with varying topic-specific vocabularies. 3) Controversies change over time, with some topics and actors becoming controversial whereas others stop to be so. Previous approaches lack the power to deal with such changes. Matching and explicit approaches are problematic when the source corpus (e.g. Wikipedia) lags after real-world changes BIBREF8 . Furthermore, lexical methods trained on common (e.g. fulltext) features are likely to memorize the controversial topics in the training set rather than the `language of controversy'. Alleviating dependence on platform specific features and reducing sensitivity to an exact lexical representation is paramount to robust controversy detection. To this end, we focus only on fulltext features and suggest to leverage the semantic representations of word embeddings to reduce the vocabulary-gap for unseen topics and exact lexical representations."

We leave the investigation of this problem to future work. On the other hand, M-CausalBert achieves a comparable or slightly better performance compared to CausalBert, which suggests that M-CausalBert leverages the data from other languages.

Specifically, we extend the ConvAI2 BIBREF1 to six languages: Chinese, French, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, and Japanese. Since the test set of ConvAI2 is hidden, we split the original validation set into a new validation set and test sets. Then, we firstly automatically translate the training, validation, and test set using APIs (PapaGo for Korean, Google Translate for other languages). For each language, we hired native speaker annotators with a fluent level of English and asked them to revise the machine-translated dialogues and persona sentences in the validation set and test set according to original English dialogues. The main goal of human annotation is to ensure the resulting conversations are coherent and fluent despite the cultural differences in target languages. Therefore, annotators are not restricted to only translate the English dialogues, and they are allowed to modify the original dialogues to improve the dialogue coherence in the corresponding language while retaining the persona information. The full annotation instructions are reported in Appendix A."

The assigned labels should be context dependent BIBREF1. For example, in the sentence \u201cTrump threatens to pull US out of World Trade Organization,\u201d the mention \u201cTrump\u201d should be labeled as /person and /person/politician, although Donald Trump also had other occupations such as businessman, TV personality, etc.",

For example, in the sentence \u201cThere were some great discussions on a variety of issues facing Federal Way,\u201d the mention \u201cFederal Way\u201d may be incorrectly labeled as a company by some FET models. Such a mistake can be avoided after linking it to the city Federal Way, Washington. For cases that require the understanding of the context, using entity linking results is also beneficial. In the aforementioned example where \u201cTrump\u201d is the mention, obtaining all the types of Donald Trump in the knowledge base (e.g., politician, businessman, TV personality, etc.) is still informative for inferring the correct type (i.e., politician) that fits the context, since they narrows the possible labels down.",

            "Document summarization from social media and news circles has received much attention for the past decades. Those problems have been addressed from many angles, one of which is feature extraction and representation. At the early stage of document summarization, features are usually engineered manually. Although the hand-crafted features have shown the ability for document summarization and sentiment analysis BIBREF13 , BIBREF9 , there are not enough efficient features to capture the semantic relations between words, phrases and sentences. Moreover, building a sufficient pool of features manually is difficult, because it requires expert knowledge and it is time-consuming. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 have built feature pool of sixteen types of features to classify sentences, such as the position of sentence, sentence length and tense. Widyantoro et. al. used content features, qualifying adjectives and meta-discourse features BIBREF14 to explore AZ task. It took efforts to engineer these features and it is also time consuming to optimize the combination of the entire features. With the advent of neural networks BIBREF15 , it is possible for computers to learn feature representations automatically. Recently, word embedding technique BIBREF16 has been widely used in the NLP community. There are plenty of cases where word embedding and sentence representations have been applied to short text classification BIBREF17 and paraphrase detection BIBREF18 . However, the effectiveness of this technique on AZ needs further study. The research question is, is it possible to extract word embeddings as features to classify sentences into the seven categories mentioned above using supervised machine learning approach?"

            "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table. TABREF2 . The seven categories are aim, contrast, own, background, other, basis and textual."

            "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table. TABREF2 . The seven categories are aim, contrast, own, background, other, basis and textual."

Standard Bag of Words (BoW) features based on single sentences, such as $n$-grams and word embeddings, may thus lead machine learning algorithms to incorrectly classify friendly or joking behavior as cyberbullying BIBREF12, BIBREF10, BIBREF9. To more reliably capture the nuances of repetition, harmful intent, visibility among peers, and power imbalance, we designed a new set of features from the social and linguistic traces of Twitter users. These measures allow our classifiers to encode the dynamic relationship between the message author and target, using network and timeline similarities, expectations from language models, and other signals taken from the message thread."

This way the neural net can learn the difference in the semantics of a joke and quote and generate more creative content using the mix of knowledge gained by training in a supervised manner on multiple categorical data. We show how our model is able to generate a joke vs quote depending on the category input for the same prefix of words. We also found that a network trained on the combined dataset generated fewer offensive jokes compared to the one trained on just the jokes (as the jokes scraped from the internet were offensive with high probability). This is the first time anyone has used controlled LSTM architecture to generate texts with different sentiments. We show how the network learns to introduce incongruities in the generated text (making it funny) when asked to generate a joke as opposed to a quote (which is inspirational).With the current resurgence of deep-neural networks and its astounding success in natural language generation, our paper tries to achieve the above goal."

We chose sigmoid as the output layer activation and the binary_crossentropy as the loss since it is a binary classification problem and the use of softmax normalizes the results which is not needed for this problem and since we use only one output node to return the activation, we applied sigmoid for the output layer activation. We performed Grid Search strategy to find the best hyper-parameters such as activations, optimizers, number of hidden layers and number of hidden neurons. We had used Keras Sequential model and we used Dense Layers which contains connections to every hidden node in the next layer.",

LSTMs, a special kind of RNN, can solve this long-term dependency problem.",

By contrast, the number of time steps for Word2Vec can either be 1, if we simply take an average of the word embeddings, or the length of the sentence, where each word has an embedding and thus the pre-trained representations are done at the word\u2019s level. We choose the approach with 1 timestep in our model because it requires less computation power. Meanwhile, we also do the length of the sentence, and 200 time steps are chosen as 200 is close to the mean amount of words in each sample and it is a fairly common choice in practice. However, since we do not have enough computation power to fine-tune (grid search) our model, we leave it out for our model and include it only in the final section.",

Relatively small numbers of hidden layers (i.e., {0, 1, 2}) and nodes (i.e., {200, 400, 600}) are selected as the basis for grid search, because this is a simple binary classification task and too many of them would cause overfitting.",

We used K-fold cross validation with $K = 3$. A grid search of kernel types and $C$ was performed in order to give us the most accurate svm model. The parameters we used for each kernel were linear and rbf while the values we used for $C$ were 0.25 ,0.5, and 0.75.

            "Unlike previous works under multi-instance framework that frequently use a selective attention module to aggregate sentence-level representations into bag-level one, we propose a innovative selective gate mechanism to perform this aggregation. The selective gate can mitigate problems existing in distantly supervised relation extraction and achieve a satisfactory empirical effectiveness. Specifically, when handling the noisy instance problem, selective attention tries to produce a distribution over all sentence in a bag; but if there is only one sentence in the bag, even the only sentence is wrongly labeled, the selective attention mechanism will be low-effective or even completely useless. Note that almost $80\\%$ of bags from popular relation extraction benchmark consist of only one sentence, and many of them suffer from the wrong label problem. In contrast, our proposed gate mechanism is competent to tackle such case by directly and dynamically aligning low gating value to the wrongly labeled instances and thus preventing noise representation being propagated."

Further, as shown in Bag 2, even if entity-aware embedding module is absent, proposed framework merely depending on selective gate can also make a correct prediction. This finding warrants more investigation into the power of the self-attention enhanced selective gate; hence, the two error cases are shown in Bags 3 and 4.",
            "Then, to further consider the necessity of entity-aware embedding, we show two error cases for SeG w/o Ent whose labels are /location/location/contains and NA respectively in Bag 3 and 4. One possible reason for the misclassification of both cases is that, due to a lack of entity-aware embedding, the remaining position features cannot provide strong information to distinguish complex context with similar relation position pattern w.r.t the two entities."

            "However, such selective attention framework is vulnerable to situations where a bag is merely comprised of one single sentence labeled; and what is worse, the only one sentence possibly expresses inconsistent relation information with the bag-level label. This scenario is not uncommon. For a popular distantly supervised relation extraction benchmark, e.g., NYT dataset BIBREF2, up to $80\\%$ of its training examples (i.e., bags) are one-sentence bags. From our data inspection, we randomly sample 100 one-sentence bags and find $35\\%$ of them is incorrectly labeled. Two examples of one-sentence bag are shown in Table TABREF1. These results indicate that, in training phrase the selective attention module is enforced to output a single-valued scalar for $80\\%$ examples, leading to an ill-trained attention module and thus hurting the performance."

We can see that, if we don't deploy CNN, simple Tree LSTM yields better result than traditional LSTM, but worse than Bidirectional LSTM. This is reasonable due to the fact that Bidirectional LSTM can enhance sentence representation by concatenating forward and backward representations. We found that adding CNN layer will decrease the accuracy in this scenario. Because when feeding into CNN, we have to reshape the feature planes otherwise convolution will not work. For example, we set convolution kernel width as 2, the input 2D tensor will have the shape lager than 2. To boost performance with CNN, we need more matching features.

The training set includes $61,160,686$ tweets posted by 6610 users, and the held-out test set includes $15,703,735$ tweets posted by 1652 users. First, we evaluated Botometer on our held-out test set. Botometer is a publicly available bot detection system designed for political dot detection. It outputs a score between 0 and 1 for a user, representing the likelihood that a user is a bot. Second, we used the Botometer score for each user as a feature in training a gradient boosting classifier which is a decision tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm with gradient boosting BIBREF23 and can be used to address class imbalance. To adapt the Botometer scores to our binary classification task, we set the threshold to $0.47$, based on performing 5-fold cross validation over the training set. To further address the class imbalance, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)BIBREF24 to create artificial instances of \"bot\" users in the training set. We also performed 5-fold cross validation over the training set to optimize parameters for the classifier; we used exponential as the loss function, set the number of estimators to 200, and set the learning rate to $0.1$. Third, we used the classifier with an extended set of features that are not used by Botometer.

Considering that \"bot\" users may re-post the same tweets, we used the ratio of a user's unique tweets to the total number of tweets posted by the user, where 0 indicates that the user has posted only the same tweet multiple times, and 1 indicates that each tweet is unique and has been posted only once. As Figure 1 illustrates, a subset of \"bot\" users (in the training set) have posted more of the same tweets than \"non-bot\" users.",

            "Topics. Considering that \"bot\" users may post tweets about a limited number of targeted topics, we used topic modeling to the measure the heterogeneity of topics in a user's tweets. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)BIBREF25 to extract the top five topics from all of the users' 1000 most recent tweets (or all the tweets if a user has posted less than 1000 tweets), and used the mean of the weights of each topic across all of a user's tweets.",
            "Mean Post Length. Considering that the length of tweets may be different between \"bot\" and \"non-bot\" users, we used the mean word length and standard deviation of a user's tweets.",
            "Profile Picture. In addition to tweet-related features, we used features based on information in users' profiles. Considering that a \"non-bot\" user's profile picture may be more likely to contain a face, we used a publicly available system to detect the number of faces in a profile picture. As Figure 2, illustrates a face was not detected in the profile picture of the majority of \"non-bot\" users (in the training set), whereas at least one face was detected in the profile picture of the majority of \"bot\" users.",

            "Method ::: Sentence Structure Recognition",
            "The sentence structure recognition process involves 2 modules: natural language processing (NLP) module and logical reasoning on result from NLP module. In this paper, we make use of the Stanford Parser tools described in BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14",
            "The NLP module tokenizes the input free text to produce a dependency-based parse tree and part-of-speech tag (POS tag). The dependency-based parse tree and the POS tag are then transform into an answer set program (ASP) BIBREF15 which contains only facts. Table TABREF13 shows the transformation of the result of NLP module into an ASP program for the sentence \u201cBill plays a game\u201d. In this table, nsubj, det, dobj and punct denote relations in the dependency-based parse tree, and mean nominal subject, determiner, direct object and punctuation respectively. Full description of all relations in a dependency-based parse tree can be found in the Universal Dependency website. The second set of notations are the POS tag PRP, VBP, DT and NN corresponding to pronoun, verb, determiner and noun. Readers can find the full list of POS tag in Penn Treebank Project.",
            "From the collection of the dependency atoms from the dependency-based parse tree, we determine the structure of a sentence using an ASP program, called $\\Pi _1$ (Listing ).",
            "Each of the rule above can be read as if the right-hand side is true then the left-hand side must be true. These rules define five possible structures of a sentence represented by the atom structure(x,y). $x$ and $y$ in the atom structure(x,y) denote the type of the structure and the number of dependency relations applied to activate the rule generating this atom, respectively. We refer to $y$ as the $i$-value of the structure. For example, $structure(1,1)$ will be recognized if the nsubj relation is in the dependency-based parse tree; $structure(3,3)$ needs 3 dependency relations to be actived: nsubj, xcomp and dobj. We often use structure #$x$ to indicate a structure of type $x$.",
            "Together with the collection of the atoms encoding the relations in the dependency-based parse tree, $\\Pi _1$ generates several atoms of the form $structure(x,y)$ for a sentence. Among all these atoms, an atom with the highest $i$-value represents the structure constructed using the highest number of dependency relations. And hence, that structure is the most informative structure that is recoginized for the sentence. Observe that $structure(1,1)$ is the most simplified structure of any sentence.",
            "Method ::: Sentence Components Recognition",
            "The goal of this step is to identify the relationship between elements of a sentence structure and chunks of words in a sentence from the POS tags and the dependency-based parse tree. For example, the sentence \u201cBill plays a game\u201d is encoded by a structure #2 and we expect that Bill, plays, and game correspond to the subject, verb, and object, respectively.",
            "We begin with recognizing the main words (components) that play the most important roles in the sentence based on a given sentence structure. This is achieved by program $\\Pi _2$ (Listing ). The first four rules of $\\Pi _2$ determine the main subject and verb of the sentence whose structure is #1, #2, #3, or #5. Structure #4 requires a special treatment since the components following tobe can be of different forms. For instance, in \u201cCathy is gorgeous,\u201d the part after tobe is an adjective, but in \u201cCathy is a beautiful girl,\u201d the part after tobe is a noun, though, with adjective beautiful. This is done using the four last rules of $\\Pi _2$.",
            "The result of program $\\Pi _2$ is an one-to-one mapping of some of the words in the sentence into the importaint components of a sentence, called main components, i.e. subject, object and verb. The mapping is constructed by using the core arguments in Universal Dependency Relations . Since not every word in the sentence is in a core argument relation, there are some words in the sentence that are not in the domain of the mapping that $\\Pi _2$ produces. We denote these words are complement components. To identify these words, we encode the Non-core dependents and Nominal dependents from Universal Dependency Relations into the set of rules in program $\\Pi _3$.",
            "Program $\\Pi _3$ (Listing ), together with the atoms extracted from the dependency-based parse tree such as $compound(P,N)$ ($N$ is compound noun at the position $P$ in the sentence), $amod(P,J)$ ($J$ is an adjective modifier), etc., is used to identify the complement components of the main components computed by $\\Pi _2$ while maintaining the structure of the sentence created by $\\Pi _1$. For example, a complement of a noun could be another noun (as \u201cboard\u201d in \u201cboard game\u201d), or an adjective (as \u201cpopular\u201d in \u201cpopular board game\u201d), or a preposition (as \u201cfor adults\u201d in \u201cboard game for adults\u201d).",
            "The input of Program $\\Pi _3$ is the position ($pos$) of the word in the sentence. Program $\\Pi _3$ is called whenever there is a new complement component discovered. That way of recursive calls is to identify the maximal chunk of the words that support the main components of the sentence. The result of this module is a list of vocabularies for the next steps.",
            "Method ::: GF Grammar Encoder",
            "The goal of the encoder is to identify appropriate GF rules for the construction of a GF grammar of a sentence given its structure and its components identified in the previous two modules. This is necessary since a sentence can be encoded in GF by more than one set of rules; for example, the sentence \u201cBill wants to play a game\u201d can be encoded by the rules",
            "In GF, NP, VV, V2, VP, and Cl stand for noun phrase, verb-phrase-complement verb, two-place verb, verb phrase and clause, respectively. Note that although the set of GF grammatical rules can be used to construct a constituency-based parse tree , the reverse direction is not always true. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no algorithm for converting a constituency-based parse tree to a set GF grammar rules. We therefore need to identify the GF rules for each sentence structure.",
            "In our system, a GF rule is assigned to a structure initially (Table TABREF19). Each rule in Table TABREF19 represents the first level of the constituency-based parse tree. It acts as the coordinator for all other succeeding rules.",
            "Given the seed components identified in Section SECREF15 and the above GF rules, a GF grammar for each sentence can be constructed. However, this grammar can only be used to generate fairly simple sentences. For example, for the sentence \u201cBill plays a popular board game with his close friends.\u201d, a GF grammar for structure #2 can be constructed, which can only generate the sentence \u201cBill plays game.\u201d because it does not contain any complement components identified in Section SECREF15. Therefore, we assgin a set of GF rules for the construction of each parameter in the GF rules in Table TABREF19. The set of GF rules has to follow two conventions. The first one is after applying the set of rules to some components of the sentence, the type of the production is one of the type in Table TABREF19, e.g. $NP$, $VP$, $Cl$, $V2$, .... The second convention is that the GF encoder will select the rules as the order from top to bottom in Table TABREF20. Note that the encoder always has information of what type of input and output for the rule it is looking for.",
            "For instance, we have \u201cgame\u201d is the object (main components), and we know that we have to construct \u201cgame\u201d in the result GF grammar to be a NP (noun phrase). Program $\\Pi _2$ identifies that there are two complement components for the word \u201cgame\u201d, which are \u201cboard\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d, a noun and an adjective respectively. The GF encoder then select the set of rules: N $\\rightarrow $ N $\\rightarrow $ CN and A $\\rightarrow $ AP to create the common noun \u201cboard game\u201d and the adjective phrase first. The next rule is AP $\\rightarrow $ CN $\\rightarrow $ CN. The last rule to be applied is CN $\\rightarrow $ NP. The selection is easily decided since the input and the output of the rules are pre-determined, and there is no ambiguity in the selection process.",
            "The encoder uses the GF rules and the components identified by the previous subsections to produce different constructors for different components of a sentence. A part of the output of the GF encoder for the object \u201cgame\u201d is",
            "The encoder will also create the operators that will be included in the oper section of the GF grammar for supporting the new constructor. For example, the following operators will be generated for serving the Game constructor above:",

By taking the union of all respective elements of each grammar for each sentence, i.e., categories, functions, linearizations and operators, the Grammar Exporter will group them into the set of categories (respectively, categories, functions, linearizations, operators) of the final grammar."

Notice that very long descriptions (class 5), on which performances drastically decrease, represent a negligible percentage of the whole set (less than 0.3%). Some remarks are mandatory. It is worth noting that this test simply estimates how much, for each report, the MagiCoder behavior is similar to the manual work, without considering the effective quality of the manual encoding. Clearly, as a set of official reports, revised and sent to RNF, we assume to deal with an high-quality encoding: notwithstanding, some errors in the human encoding possibly occur. Moreover, the query we perform to compare manual and automatic encoding is, obviously, quantitative. For each VigiSegn report, the query is able to detect common retrieved terms and terms returned either by the human expert or by MagiCoder. It is not able to fairly test redundancy errors: human experts make some encoding choices in order to avoid repetitions. Thus, an LLT INLINEFORM0 returned by MagiCoder that has not been selected by the expert because redundant is not truly a false positive.

Next, we will examine a small portion of the dataset manually, which will be partly randomly sampled and partly selected to contain recovery-related terms. Based on this, we will be able to expand the dictionary and additionally automatically annotate semantic concepts of the identified relevant text passages using a semantic tagging approach such as the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) BIBREF64 . Crucially for the multilingual aspect of the project, USAS can tag semantic categories in eight languages BIBREF8 . Then, semantic tagging will be applied to the full corpus to retrieve all text passages mentioning relevant concepts. Furthermore, distributional semantics methods BIBREF65 , BIBREF66 can be used to find terms that frequently co-occur with words from our keyword dictionary.

            "Concurrently, it has been argued for mental health research that it would constitute a `valuable critical step' BIBREF10 to analyse first-hand accounts by individuals with lived experience of severe mental health issues in blog posts, tweets, and discussion forums. Several severe mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being relapse and symptom free for a sustained period of time BIBREF11 , is considered difficult to achieve BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 . Second, unlike for some other severe mental health difficulties, return to normal functioning is achievable given appropriate treatment BIBREF28 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF29 ."

A key point is they defined a unified format to formulate different types of training samples, as [form, identifier 1, theme, identifier 2, body], where \u201cbody\u201d accommodates the full content of an SHI, CI, or couplet in corresponding \u201cform\u201d with \u201ctheme\u201d as its title. Experiments demonstrated GPT-based poem generation gained promising performance, meanwhile still faced some limitations, for instance, only 70% of the generated CIs for the Cipai Shuidiaogetou, a sort of CI with quite long body, are correct in form.",
            "Regarding this, we think the work of liao2019gpt could be improved in the following three respects. First, there is a large improving room for better fitting the form requirement of CI in the process of generation, especially for those with relatively long body length. Second, their formulation format for training samples can be supplemented, for example, the stanza structure of CI is missing. Third, using contemporary Chinese news corpus to pre-train the model may not be necessary, owing to distinctive differences in both meaning and form between contemporary Chinese and Chinese classical poetry language."

We initialize the word embedding layer with 100 dimensional pre-trained GloVe vectors BIBREF8, and fine-tune initialized word vectors during our model training. We use Adagrad BIBREF16 for optimizing the parameters with initial learning rate 0.001 and batch size 128.",
            "We first follow BIBREF5 (BIBREF5) evaluating our proposed approach on the hard similarity task. The goal of this task is that similar events should be close to each other in the same vector space, while dissimilar events should be far away with each other. To this end, BIBREF5 (BIBREF5) created two types of event pairs, one with events that should be close to each other but have very little lexical overlap (e.g., police catch robber / authorities apprehend suspect), and another with events that should be farther apart but have high overlap (e.g., police catch robber / police catch disease).",
            "The labeled dataset contains 230 event pairs (115 pairs each of similar and dissimilar types). Three different annotators were asked to give the similarity/dissimilarity rankings, of which only those the annotators agreed upon completely were kept. For each event representation learning method, we obtain the cosine similarity score of the pairs, and report the fraction of cases where the similar pair receives a higher cosine value than the dissimilar pair (we use Accuracy $\\in [0,1]$ denoting it). To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we extend this dataset to 1,000 event pairs (similar and dissimilar events each account for 50%), and we will release this dataset to the public.",
            "Following BIBREF21 (BIBREF21), we evaluate on the standard multiple choice narrative cloze (MCNC) dataset BIBREF2. As SGNN proposed by BIBREF21 (BIBREF21) achieved state-of-the-art performances for this task, we use the framework of SGNN, and only replace their input event embeddings with our intent and sentiment-enhanced event embeddings."

We run a forward and a backward LSTM over the character embeddings. The forward LSTM reads the beginning of word symbol, but not the end of word symbol, and the backward LSTM reads the end of word symbol but not the beginning of word symbol.

This means one of the LSTMs can specialize on word prefixes and roots, while the other memorizes possible suffixes. In addition, when dealing with an unknown word, it can be split into known and unknown components. The model can then use the semantic knowledge it has learnt for a known component to predict a representation for the unknown word as a whole.",

In this model, the word embeddings are just the concatenation of the final forward and backward states, passed through a feedforward layer. We refer to this model as C2V-NO-ATT. We also constructed count-based vectors using SVD on PPMI-weighted co-occurence counts, with a window size of 3. We kept the top 256 principal components in the SVD decomposition, to obtain embeddings with the same size as our other models.",

Traditional hard morphological analyzers are normally evaluated on border $F_1$ \u2013 that is, how many morpheme borders are recovered. However, our model does not actually posit any hard morpheme borders. Instead, it just associates each character boundary with a weight. Therefore, we treat the problem of recovering intra-word morpheme boundaries as a ranking problem. We rank each inter-character boundary of a word according to our model weights, and then evaluate whether our model ranks morpheme boundaries above non-morpheme boundaries.",
            "We use mean average precision (MAP) as our evaluation metric. We first calculate precision at $N$ for each word, until all the gold standard morpheme boundaries have been recovered.

On these words, our model even outperforms Morfessor, which is explicitly designed as a morphological analyzer. This shows that our model learns splits which correspond well to human morphological analysis, even though we build no morphological knowledge into our model. However, when evaluating on all words, the Porter stemmer has a great advantage, as it is rule-based and able to give just the stem of words with great precision, which is effectively giving a canonical segmentation for words with just 2 morphemes.",

However, character-based models are competitive with word-based models on the RW dataset. While the words in this dataset appear rarely in our corpus (of the in-corpus words, over half appear fewer than 100 times), each morpheme may be common, and the character-level models can use this information. We note that on the entire RW dataset (of which over half contain an OOV word), the character-based models still perform reasonably. We also note that on word pairs in the RW test containing at least one OOV word, the full Char2Vec model outperforms the C2V model without morphology. This suggests that character-based embedding models are learning to morphologically analyse complex word forms, even on unseen words, and that giving the model the capability to learn word segments independently helps this process.",

We note that nearest neighbour predictions include words that are orthographically distant but semantically similar, showing that our model has the capability to learn to compose characters into word meanings.",
            "We also note that word nearest neighbours seem to be more semantically coherent when rarely-observed words are filtered out of the vocabulary, and more based on orthographic overlap when the entire vocabulary is included.

We split this collection into semantic and syntactic sections, based on whether the analogies between the words are driven by morphological changes or deeper semantic shifts. Example semantic questions are on capital-country relationships (\u201cParis is to France as Berlin is to X) and currency-country relationships. Example syntactic questions are adjective-adverb relationships (\u201camazing is to amazingly as apparent is to X\u201d) and opposites formed by prefixing a negation particle (\u201cacceptable is to unacceptable as aware is to X\u201d).

The most intriguing result is that character-level models are competitive with word-level models for syntactic analogy, with our Char2Vec model holding the best result for syntactic analogy answering. This suggests that incorporating morphological knowledge explicitly rather than latently helps the model learn morphological features. However, on the semantic analogies, the character-based models do much worse than the word-based models. This is perhaps unsurprising in light of the previous section, where we demonstrate that character-based models do worse at the semantic similarity task than word-level models.",

We thus expect our model to perform even better for languages with a richer morphology than English, such as Turkish and German.",
            "Conclusion",
            "In this paper, we present a model which learns morphology and word embeddings jointly. Given a word, it splits the word in to segments and ranks the segments based on their context-predictive power. Our model can segment words into morphemes, and also embed the word into a representation space.",
            "We show that our model is competitive at the task of morpheme boundary recovery compared to a dedicated morphological analyzer, beating dedicated analyzers on words with a rich morphology. We also show that in the representation space word affixation corresponds to linear shifts, demonstrating that our model can learn morphological features.",
            "Finally, we show that character-level models, while outperformed by word-level models generally at the task of semantic similarity, are competitive at representing rare morphologically rich words. In addition, the character-level models can predict good quality representations for unseen words, with the morphologically aware character-level model doing slightly better."

However, the basic RNN has problems dealing with long term dependencies in data due to the vanishing gradient problem BIBREF21. Some solutions to the vanishing gradient problem involve careful initialization of network parameters or early stopping BIBREF22. But the most effective solution is to modify the RNN architecture in such a way that there exists a memory state (cell state) at every time step that can identify what to remember and what to forget. This architecture is referred to as long short term memory (LSTM) network BIBREF23. While the basic RNN is a direct transformation of the previous state and the current input, the LSTM maintains an internal memory and has mechanisms to update and use that memory. This is achieved by deploying four separate neural networks also called gates. Figure FIGREF12 depicts a cell of an LSTM network which shows input at the current time step ${x_t}$ and the previous state ${h_{t-1}}$ enter into the cell; and get concatenated. The forget gate processes it to remove unnecessary information, and outputs ${f_t}$ which gets multiplied with the previously stored memory ${C_{t-1}}$ and produces a refined memory for the current time.",

We flatten every dimension except time and at each time step we can feed a vector of size $R^{3 \\times J}$ as input. However, we have empirically verified that learning a sequential pattern for each coordinate axis independently and combining them later shows stronger classification performance. Based on this, we trained three different 2 layer LSTMs for data from x, y, and z coordinates separately; and concatenate their final embedding to produce softmax output. In this setting, each separate LSTM receives data as $R^{T \\times J}$ and final embedding size is $R^{3\\times S}$ where $S$ is the state size of LSTM cell. Figure FIGREF15 (a) shows the architecture where as a sample arrives, just before entering into main network, data along separate axis is split and entered into three different LSTM networks.

It fails to capture any such interaction among joints in a given time. To incorporate spatial relationship among joints, we propose a simple novel data augmentation technique for skeletal data. We do this by origin transfer. For each frame in a gesture sample, we use each wrist joints as origin and transform all other joints' data by subtracting that origin from them. In this way spatial information is added to the input. We refer this model with spatial data augmentation as Spatial AI-LSTM. This augmentation technique is depicted in Figure FIGREF21. A sample data of form $R^{T \\times 6 \\times 3}$ results in a representation of $R^{T \\times 5 \\times 3}$ after subtracting left wrist joint (origin transfer). After this augmentation process, each sample is a $R^{20 \\times 16 \\times 3}$ matrix. Hence, each separate LSTM networks in our Spatial AI-LSTM network receives an input of $R^{20 \\times 16}$.",

This architecture has two parts: one for left hand patches and other for right hand patches. Each part has four 3D convolutional layers (second and fourth layers have following maximum pooling layers) followed by 2 fully connected layers. Final embeddings from these two parts are concatenated and by using a softmax layer, from which a classification score is produced. The other AI-LSTM network is fed with skeletal time series data. At the final time step, the LSTM state vector is taken and using a softmax layer another probability score is produced. The final classification score is created by taking element wise maximum of the output scores from the two networks. During back\u2013propagation, both networks are trained on their own score.

            "RNN has shown success in modeling sequential pattern in dataBIBREF6. It can capture temporal dynamics in data by maintaining an internal state. However, the basic RNN has problems dealing with long term dependencies in data due to the vanishing gradient problem BIBREF21. Some solutions to the vanishing gradient problem involve careful initialization of network parameters or early stopping BIBREF22. But the most effective solution is to modify the RNN architecture in such a way that there exists a memory state (cell state) at every time step that can identify what to remember and what to forget. This architecture is referred to as long short term memory (LSTM) network BIBREF23. While the basic RNN is a direct transformation of the previous state and the current input, the LSTM maintains an internal memory and has mechanisms to update and use that memory. This is achieved by deploying four separate neural networks also called gates. Figure FIGREF12 depicts a cell of an LSTM network which shows input at the current time step ${x_t}$ and the previous state ${h_{t-1}}$ enter into the cell; and get concatenated. The forget gate processes it to remove unnecessary information, and outputs ${f_t}$ which gets multiplied with the previously stored memory ${C_{t-1}}$ and produces a refined memory for the current time.",

A layer also has a certain numbers of filters which are rectangular patches of parameters. Each filter convolves over the stack of 2D feature maps at previous layer and produces feature maps (equal to the number of filters in the current layer) at current layer. The operation is given by Equation DISPLAY_FORM17 where $F_{i,j}^{l}$ denotes the value of feature map at $l^{th}$ layer at location $(i,j)$. $\\odot $ represents dot product of filter $W$ and associated feature map patch in previous layer.",

            "Given a sample skeletal data of $R^{T \\times J \\times 3}$, where $T$ denotes time axis, $J$ is the number of body joints and the last dimension is the 3D coordinates of each joint. We flatten every dimension except time and at each time step we can feed a vector of size $R^{3 \\times J}$ as input. However, we have empirically verified that learning a sequential pattern for each coordinate axis independently and combining them later shows stronger classification performance. Based on this, we trained three different 2 layer LSTMs for data from x, y, and z coordinates separately; and concatenate their final embedding to produce softmax output. In this setting, each separate LSTM receives data as $R^{T \\times J}$ and final embedding size is $R^{3\\times S}$ where $S$ is the state size of LSTM cell. Figure FIGREF15 (a) shows the architecture where as a sample arrives, just before entering into main network, data along separate axis is split and entered into three different LSTM networks.

Moreover, even when controlling for the amount of data, the WER of the ASR model from pretraining seems to be a better predictor of final AST performance than does language relatedness. Indeed, we show that there is a very strong correlation between the WER of the pretraining model and BLEU score of the final AST model\u2014i.e., the best pretraining strategy may simply be to use datasets and methods that will yield the lowest ASR WER during pretraining. However, we also found that AST results can be improved further by augmenting the AST data using standard speed perturbation techniques BIBREF11. Our best results using non-English pretraining data improve the test set BLEU scores of an AST system trained on 20 hours of parallel data from 10.2 to 14.3, increasing to 15.8 with data augmentation."

Different approaches have been developed to represent and execute clinical guidelines over patient-specific clinical data. They include document-centric models, decision trees and probabilistic models, and \"Task-Network Models\"(TNMs) BIBREF5 , which represent guideline knowledge in hierarchical structures containing networks of clinical actions and decisions that unfold over time. Serban et. al BIBREF6 developed a methodology for extracting and using linguistic patterns in guideline formalization, to aid the human modellers in guideline formalization and reduce the human modelling effort. Kaiser et. al BIBREF7 developed a method to identify activities to be performed during a treatment which are described in a guideline document. They used relations of the UMLS Semantic Network BIBREF8 to identify these activities in a guideline document. Wenzina and Kaiser BIBREF4 developed a rule-based method to automatically identifying conditional activities in guideline documents.They achieved a recall of 75% and a precision of 88% on chapter 4 of asthma guidelines which was mentioned before.",

If the transformed/paraphrased sentence conveyed the same meaning as the original, we considered to be a condition-consequence sentence. Then we we could annotate condition and consequence parts. For example, we paraphrased \"Beta-blockers, including eye drops, are contraindicated in patients with asthma\" to \"If patients have asthma, then beta-blockers, including eye drops, are contraindicated\". The paraphrased sentence conveys same meaning. So it became a condition-consequence sentence in our dataset.

Slang identification and emoticons were also crucial steps in the study. Slang are a group of words which are used informally and in a particular language. Emoticons are the representation of different facial expressions. SVM performed the best among all the algorithms with accuracy of 90% and 70% for Marathi and Hindi language.",
            "SWN is a most common lexicon-based approach used by the researchers. Haithem et al. BIBREF9 developed the Irish SWN whose accuracy was 6% greater than the accuracy obtained by transliteration of the Irish Tweets into English language. The lexicon was manually created. The accuracy difference between the systems was because of the translation carried out into the English language BIBREF9. Naidu et al. BIBREF10 carried out the SA on Telugu e-newspapers. Their system was divided in two steps. First step was subjectivity classification. Second step was sentiment classification. In the first step the sentences were divided as subjective and objective sentences. In the second step only, the subjective sentences were further classified as positive, negative and neutral. Both the steps were performed using the SWN which gave the accuracy of 74% and 81% BIBREF10.",
            "Pandey et al. BIBREF12 defined a framework to carry out the SA task on the Hindi movie reviews. BIBREF12 observed that the lower accuracy was obtained by using SWN as a classification technique and hence suggested using synset replacement algorithm along with the SWN. Synset replacement algorithms groups the synonymous words having same concepts together. It helped in increasing the accuracy of the system because if the word was not present in the Hindi SWN then it found the closest word and assigned the score of that word BIBREF12. In the study, Bhargava et al. BIBREF13 completed the SA task on the FIRE 2015 dataset. The dataset consisted of code-mixed sentences in English along with 4 Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu). The architecture consisted of 2 main steps Language Identification and Sentiment Classification. Punctuations, hashtags were identified and handled by the CMU Ark tagger. Machine learning techniques like logistic regression and SVM were used for language identification. SWN\u2019s of each language were used for sentiment classification. The results of the implemented system were compared with the previous language translation technique and 8% better precision was observed BIBREF13.",
            "Kaur, Mangat and Krail BIBREF14 carried out their SA task on Hinglish language, which is code mix language highly popular in India. It is mainly used for the social media communication. The authors [10] had created a Hinglish corpus which contained movie reviews domain specific Hindi words. Stop-word removal, tokenization were the pre-processing techniques used in the system, along with TF-IDF as the vectorization technique. Classification algorithms like SVM and Na\u00efve Bayes where used to carry out the classification task. As a future work, the authors in BIBREF14 are trying to find the best feature and classifier combination.",

BIBREF15 performed SA on the Tibetan language and hence collected the data from the Tibetan micro-blog. In BIBREF6 112 Hindi text file pertaining to different domains have been collected for analysis. Authors in BIBREF18 have used the SAIL Dataset which consist of training and test data for three different languages. Approximately 1000 tweets for each language was present as a training data. BIBREF21 extracted the data from the YouTube comments. The data extracted was related to the cookery website from 2 channels. Total of 9800 comments were collected.",
            "In the paper, Godino et al. BIBREF25 carried out SA on Spanish tweets using three different classifier models which are feature classifier, FastText classifier, BERT classifier. Feature classifier extracted the important features from the tweets such as the length of the tweets, number of hashtags etc. and applied these features to the traditional machine learning algorithms to carry out the sentiment classification. The traditional algorithms used where: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost. FastText Classifier was developed by Facebook AI research and it internally works on the neural network architecture. BERT Classifier was also applied on the tweets. The output of the three classifiers were combined using the averaging assembling. The model was evaluated using the F1 score. F1 score of 45% and 46% was obtained on the train and test data of the implemented model.",
            "Joshi et al. BIBREF16 carried out SA on the Gujarati tweets. Stopword removal, stemming were the pre-processing techniques used in the implemented model. Feature extraction technique Parts of Speech (POS) tagging and the classification algorithm SVM was used in the system. SVM performed very well and gave the accuracy of 92%. Sharma et al. BIBREF17 tried to predict the Indian election results by extracting the Hindi tweets for political domain. The tweets were mainly for 5 major political parties. Three approaches where implemented to predict the winner in the election. First approach was dictionary based in which n-gram was used as a pre-processing technique and TF-IDF was used as a vectorization technique. SWN was used to classify the data and assign the polarity score to the words. Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm and SVM were the remaining two approaches which were used. SVM and Na\u00efve Bayes predicted party BJP (Bhartiya Janta Party) as the winner. SVM had the accuracy of 78.4% which was highest among the three implemented approaches.",

            "The proposed model architecture is based on a multi-path approach for each of the involved input data types namely, instructions, ingredients and images, similarly to BIBREF19. In Figure FIGREF4, the overall structure is presented. For the instruction encoder, we utilized a self-attention mechanism BIBREF20, which learns which words of the instructions are relevant with a certain ingredient. In order to encode the ingredients, a bidirectional RNN is used, since ingredients are an unordered list of words. All RNNs in the ingredients path were implemented with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells BIBREF21. We fixed the ingredient representation to have a length of 600, independent of the amount of ingredients. Lastly, the outputs of the self-attention-instruction encoder with ingredient attention and the output of the bidirectional LSTM ingredient-encoder are concatenated and mapped to the joint embedding space. The image analysis path is composed of a ResNet-50 model BIBREF22, pretrained on the ImageNet Dataset BIBREF23, with a custom top layer for mapping the image features to the joint embedding space. All word embeddings are pretrained with the word2vec algorithm BIBREF24 and fine tuned during the joint embedding learning phase. We chose 512-dimensional word embedding for our model with self-attention, whereas BIBREF19 and BIBREF17 chose a vector length of 300. In the following sections, more details about the aforementioned paths are presented.",
            "The emergence of multi-modal databases has led to novel approaches for meal image analysis. The fusion of visual features learned from images by deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and textual features lead to outstanding results in food recognition applications. An early approach for recipe retrieval was based on jointly learning to predict food category and its ingredients using deep CNN BIBREF16. In a following step, the predicted ingredients are matched against a large corpus of recipes. More recent approach is proposed by BIBREF15 and is based on jointly learning recipe-text and image representations in a shared latent space. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CNN are mainly used to map text and image into the shared space. To align the text and image embedding vectors between matching recipe-image pairs, cosine similarity loss with margin was applied. Carvalho et al. BIBREF17 proposed a similar multi-modal embedding method for aligning text and image representations in a shared latent space. In contrast to Salvador et al. BIBREF15, they formulated a joint objective function which incorporates the loss for the cross-modal retrieval task and a classification loss, instead of using the latent space for a multitask learning setup. To address the challenge of encoding long sequences (like recipe instructions), BIBREF15 chose to represent single instructions as sentence embedding using the skip-thought technique BIBREF18. These encoded instruction sentences are referred to as skip-instructions and their embedding is not fine tuned when learning the image-text joint embedding."

            "Finally, in Figure 7, we illustrate how LGI performed the human-like language-guided thinking process, with the above-learned syntaxes. (1) LGI first closed its eyes, namely, that no input images were fed into the vision subsystem (all the subsequent input images were generated through the imagination process). (2) LGI said to itself \u2018give me a 9\u2019, then the PFC produced the corresponding encoding vector INLINEFORM0 , and finally one digit \u20189\u2019 instance was reconstructed via the imagination network. (3) LGI gave the command \u2018rotate 180\u2019, then the imagined digit \u20189\u2019 was rotated upside down. (4) Following the language command \u2018this is \u2019, LGI automatically predicted that the newly imaged object was the digit \u20186\u2019. (5) LGI used \u2018enlarge\u2019 command to make the object bigger. (6) Finally, LGI predicted that the size was \u2018big\u2019 according to the imagined object morphology. This demonstrates that LGI can understand the verbs and nouns by properly manipulating the imagination, and can form the iterative thinking process via the interaction between vision and language subsystems through the PFC layer. The human thinking process normally would not form a concrete imagination through the full visual loop, but rather a vague and rapid imagination through the short-cut loop by feeding back INLINEFORM1 to AIT directly. On the other hand, the full path of clear imagination may explain the dream mechanism. Figure 7.B shows the short cut imagination process, where LGI also regarded the rotated \u20189\u2019 as digit 6, which suggests the AIT activation does not encode the digit identity, but the untangled features of input image or imagined image. Those high level cortices beyond visual cortex could be the place for identity representation."

            "In this paper, we first introduced a PFC layer to involve representations from both language and vision subsystems to form a human-like thinking system (the LGI system). The LGI contains three subsystems: the vision, language, and PFC subsystem, which are trained separately. The development, recognition and learning mechanism is discussed in the cocurrent paper [10]. In the language subsystem, we use an LSTM layer to mimic the human IPS to extract the quantity information from language text and proposed a biologically plausible textizer to produce text symbols output, instead of traditional softmax classifier. We propose to train the LGI with the NFP loss function, which endows the capacity to describe the image content in form of symbol text and manipulated images according to language commands. LGI shows its ability to learn eight different syntaxes or tasks in a cumulative learning way, and form the first machine thinking loop with the interaction between imagined pictures and language text."

To improve the language command recognition, we added one LSTM layer to extract the quantity information of the text (for example, suppose text = \u2018move left 12\u2019, the expected output INLINEFORM1 is 1 dimensional quantity 12 at the last time point). This layer mimics the number processing functionality of human Intra-Parietal Sulcus (IPS), so it is given the name IPS layer. The PFC outputs the desired activation of INLINEFORM2 , which can either be decoded by the \u2018texitizer\u2019 into predicted text or serve as INLINEFORM3 for the next iteration of the imagination process. Here, we propose a textizer (a rounding operation, followed by symbol mapping from binary vector, whose detailed discussion can be referred to the Supplementary section A) to classify the predicted symbol instead of softmax operation which has no neuroscience foundation."

For the game Go [22, 23], the network using a reinforcement learning strategy has to be trained with billions of games in order to acquire a feeling (Q value estimated for each potential action) to move the chess. As human beings, after knowing the rule conveyed by language, we can quickly start a game with proper moves using a try-in-imagination strategy without requiring even a single practice. With imagination, people can change the answering contents (or even tell good-will lies) by considering or imagining the consequence of the next few output sentences.

Using car as an example [17], during training, the autoencoder learns the 3D characteristics of a car with a pair of images from two views of the same car together with the viewpoint of the output view. During testing, the autoencoder could predict the desired image from a single image of the car given the expected viewpoint. However, this architecture is task-specific, namely that the network can only make predictions on cars' unseen views. To include multiple tasks, we added an additional PFC layer that can receive task commands conveyed via language stream and object representation via the visual encoder pathway, and output the modulated images according to task commands and the desired text prediction associated with the images. In addition, by transmitting the output image from the decoder to the encoder, an imagination loop is formed, which enables the continual operation of a human-like thinking process involving both language and image."

When evaluated on non-factoid QA datasets, there is a big gap between BERT embeddings and the fully fine-tuned BERT, which suggests that deep interactions between questions and answers are critical to the task. However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected. Similar to BERT for sentence embeddings, mean-pooling and combining the top and bottom layer embeddings lead to better performance, and $(u, v, u * v, |u - v|)$ shows the strongest results among other interaction schemes. Different from sentence-level embeddings, fine-tuning BERT on SNLI doesn't lead to significant improvement, which suggests possible domain mismatch between SNLI and the QA datasets.

The user evaluates the \u201cfunniness\u201d of a posted caption and assigns one to three stars to the caption. Therefore, funnier captions tend to be assigned a lot of stars. We focus on the number of stars in order to propose an effective training method, in which the Funny Score enables us to evaluate the funniness of a caption. Based on the results of our pre-experiment, a Funny Score of 100 stars is treated as a threshold. In other words, the Funny Score outputs a loss value INLINEFORM0 when #star is less than 100. In contrast, the Funny Score returns INLINEFORM1 when #star is over 100. The loss value INLINEFORM2 is calculated with the LSTM as an average of each mini-batch."

One may have to adapt/repair the ASR output in order to do further natural language processing such as question-answering. We have presented two mechanisms for adaptation/repair of ASR-output with respect to a domain. The Evo-Devo mechanism provides a bio-inspired abstraction to help structure the adaptation and repair process. This is one of the main contribution of this paper. The machine learning mechanism provides a means of adaptation and repair by examining the feature-space of the ASR output.

We train multilingual bnfs on between one and ten languages from the GlobalPhone collection and evaluate on six other languages (simulating different zero-resource targets). We show that training on more languages consistently improves performance on word discrimination, and that the improvement is not simply due to more training data: an equivalent amount of data from one language fails to give the same benefit. In fact, we observe the largest gain in performance when adding the second training language, which is already better than adding three times as much data from the same language. Moreover, when compared to our best results from training unsupervised on target language data only, we find that bnfs trained on just a single other language already outperform the target-language-only training, with multilingual bnfs doing better by a wide margin."

As they follow the trend of stacking forward and backward LSTMs independently, the Baseline-BiLSTM-CNN is only able to learn higher-level representations of past or future per se. Instead, Cross-BiLSTM-CNN, which interleaves every layer of the two directions, models cross-context in an additive manner by learning higher-level representations of the whole context of each token. On the other hand, Att-BiLSTM-CNN models cross-context in a multiplicative manner by capturing the interaction between past and future with a dot-product self-attentive mechanism BIBREF5, BIBREF6."

For INLINEFORM3 , the same INLINEFORM4 model that worked best in the 50-class setup again outperforms the others. Here, in contrast to the 50-class setting, using the full set of tweets usually performs better than focusing only on the human activity content.

Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task). In this work we perform an extensive evaluation of 9 unsupervised and 4 supervised tweet representation models, using 8 different properties. The most relevant work is that of Adi et al. [5], which investigates three sentence properties in comparing unsupervised sentence representation models such as average of words vectors and LSTM auto-encoders. We differ from their work in two ways: (1) While they focus on sentences, we focus on social media posts which opens up the challenge of considering multiple salient properties such as hashtags, named entities, conversations and so on. (2) While they work with only unsupervised representation-learning models, we investigate the traditional unsupervised methods (BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW, Tweet2Vec), as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM)."

An optimized word reward score always leads to improvements in METEOR scores over any of the best baselines. Across all language pairs, reward and norm have close METEOR scores, though the reward method wins out slightly. BLEU scores for reward and norm also increase over the baseline in most cases, despite BLEU's inherent bias towards shorter sentences. Most notably, whereas the baseline Russian\u2013English system lost more than 20 BLEU points when the beam was increased to 1000, our tuned reward score resulted in a BLEU gain over any baseline beam size.

It is important to see that optimizing an agent to generate text based on what it sees in the two-turn conversation dataset that it is trained on does not mean that the agent would be able to generalize to human level conversation across contexts. Nevertheless in absence of a better way to capture human communication this approach laid the foundation of most of the modern advances in the field.

These methods laid the ground work for the current models. However these models were expensive to create and the features depended on the domain that the conversational agent was created for. It was hard to modify these models for a new domain. As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents. Sequence to sequence model created in 2015 was capable of handling utterances of variable lengths, the application of sequence to sequence to conversation agents truly revolutionized the domain. After this advancement the field has literally exploded with numerous application in the last couple of years. The results have been impressive enough to find their way into commercial applications such that these agents have become truly ubiquitous. We attempt to present a broad view of these advancements with a focus on the main challenges encountered by the conversational agents and how these new approaches are trying to mitigate them."

In this paper, they replace the symbolic queries (which break the differentiability of the system and prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents) with an induced \u2018soft\u2019 posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both simulations and against real users.",

Just for a heads up, actor-critic algorithms are the algorithms that have an actor stores the policy according to which the action is taken by the agent and a critic that critiques the actions chosen by the actor (that is, the rewards obtained after the action are sent to the critic using which it calculates value functions).",
            "To speed up the learning process, they presented two sample-efficient neural networks algorithms: trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and episodic natural actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER). Both models employ off-policy learning with experience replay to improve sample-efficiency. For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid catastrophic model changes. For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the steepest ascent direction in policy space to speed up the convergence.",

The generative model defines the policy that generates a response given the dialog history and the discriminative model is a binary classifier that takes a sequence of dialog utterances as inputs and outputs whether the input is generated by the humans or machines.

It allowed users the maximum flexibility to express their requests in whatever syntax they found most natural and the interface was based on a broad-coverage NLP system unlike the system discussed in the previous paragraph. In this, a labelled semantic graph is generated from the speech input which encodes case frames or thematic roles. After this, a sequence of graph transformations is applied on it using the knowledge of interaction scenario and application domain. This results into a normalized application specific structure called as task graph which is then matched against the templates (in the application) which represent the normalized task graphs corresponding to all the possible user statements that the assistant understands and the action is then executed. The accuracy was not that good and they did not bother to calculate it. Also, due to the integrated nature of conversational interaction in Persona, the necessary knowledge must be provided to each component of the system.

            "The idea of machine translation was a tempting idea in the 1950s. The main military interest in machine translation as an intelligence gathering tool (translation of scientific papers, daily press, technical reports, and everything the intelligence services could get their hands on) was sparked by the Soviet advance in nuclear technology, and would later be compounded by the success of Vostok 1 (termed by the USA as a \u201cstrategic surprise\u201d). In the nuclear age, being able to read and understand what the other side was working on was of crucial importance BIBREF4. Machine translation was quickly absorbed in the program of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956 (where Artificial Intelligence as a field was born), as one of the five core fields of artificial intelligence (later to be known as natural language processing). One other field was included here, the \u201cnerve nets\u201d as they were known back then, today commonly known as artificial neural networks. What is also essential for our discussion is that the earliest programming language for artificial intelligence, Lisp, was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy BIBREF5. But let us take a closer look at the history of machine translation. In the USA, the first major wave of government and military funding for machine translation came in 1954, and the period of abundancy lasted until 1964, when the National Research Council established the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC), which was to assess the results of the ten years of intense funding. The findings were very negative, and funding was almost gone BIBREF4, hence the ALPAC report became the catalyst for the first \u201cAI Winter\u201d."

            "The step which was needed here was to eliminate the notion of structure alignment and just seek sentential alignment. This, in theory, can be done by using only entropy. A simple alignment could be made by using word entropies in both languages and aligning the words by decreasing entropy. This would work better for translating into a language with no articles. A better approach, which was not beyond the thinking of the group since it was already proposed by Matkovi\u0107 in his dissertation from 1957 BIBREF20, would be to use word bigrams and align them. It is worth mentioning that, although the idea of machine translation in the 1950s in Croatia did not have a significant influence on development of the field, it shows that Croatian linguists had contemporary views and necessary competencies for its development. But, unfortunately, the development of machine translation in Croatia had been stopped because of the previously discussed circumstances. In 1964, Laszlo went to the USA, where he spent the next seven years, and after returning to Croatia, he was active as a university professor, but because of disagreement with the ruling political option regarding Croatian language issues, he published very rarely and was mainly focused on other linguistic issues in that period, but his work was a major influence on the later development of computational linguistics in Croatia."

Unlike their colleagues in the USA and the USSR, Laszlo\u2019s group had to manage without an actual computer (which is painfully obvious in BIBREF12), and the results remained mainly theoretical. Appealing probably to the political circles of the time, Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that, although it sounds strange, research in computational linguistics is mainly a top-priority military effort in other countries BIBREF11. There is a quote from BIBREF10 which perhaps best delineates the optimism and energy that the researchers in Zagreb had:"

            "Finka and Laszlo envisioned three main data preparation tasks that are needed before prototype development could commence BIBREF10. The first task is to compile a dictionary of words sorted from the end of the word to the beginning. This would enable the development of what is now called stemming and lemmatization modules: a knowledge base with suffixes so they can be trimmed, but also a systematic way to find the base of the word (lemmatization) (p. 121). The second task would be to make a word frequency table. This would enable focusing on a few thousand most frequent words and dropping the rest. This is currently a good industrial practice for building efficient natural language processing systems, and in 1962, it was a computational necessity. The last task was to create a good thesaurus, but such a thesaurus where every data point has a \"meaning\" as the key, and words (synonyms) as values. The prototype would then operate on these meanings when they become substituted for words."

            "In the USSR, there were four major approaches to machine translation in the late 1950s BIBREF7. The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built.

These signals are developed based on insights gathered from analyzing propaganda material published by known extremist groups. In this study, we focus mainly on the ISIS group as they are one of the leading terrorist groups that utilise social media to share their propaganda and recruit individuals. We analyze the propaganda material they publish in their online English magazine called Dabiq, and use data-mining techniques to computationally uncover contextual text and psychological properties associated with these groups. From our analysis of these texts, we are able to extract a set of signals that provide some insight into the mindset of the radical group. This allows us to create a general radical profile that we apply as a signal to detect pro-ISIS supporters on Twitter. Our results show that these identified signals are indeed critical to help improve existing efforts to detect online radicalization.",
            "Another angle for analyzing written text is by looking at the psychological properties that can be inferred regarding their authors. This is typically called psycholinguistics, where one examines how the use of the language can be indicative of different psychological states. Examples of such psychological properties include introversion, extroversion, sensitivity, and emotions. One of the tools that automates the process of extracting psychological meaning from text is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) BIBREF8 tool. This approach has been used in the literature to study the behaviour of different groups and to predict their psychological states, such as predicting depression BIBREF9 . More recently, it has also been applied to uncover different psychological properties of extremist groups and understand their intentions behind the recruitment campaigns BIBREF10 .",

The dataset consists of around INLINEFORM0 tweets posted by more than 100 users. These tweets were labelled as being pro-ISIS by looking at specific indicators, such as a set of keywords used (in the user's name, description, tweet text), their network of follower/following of other known radical accounts, and sharing of images of the ISIS flag or some radical leaders. To validate that these accounts are indeed malicious, we checked the current status of the users' accounts in the dataset and found that most of them had been suspended by Twitter. This suggests that they did, in fact, possess a malicious behaviour that opposes the Twitter platform terms of use which caused them to be suspended. We filter out any tweets posted by existing active users and label this dataset as known-bad."

These signals are developed based on insights gathered from analyzing propaganda material published by known extremist groups. In this study, we focus mainly on the ISIS group as they are one of the leading terrorist groups that utilise social media to share their propaganda and recruit individuals. We analyze the propaganda material they publish in their online English magazine called Dabiq, and use data-mining techniques to computationally uncover contextual text and psychological properties associated with these groups. From our analysis of these texts, we are able to extract a set of signals that provide some insight into the mindset of the radical group. This allows us to create a general radical profile that we apply as a signal to detect pro-ISIS supporters on Twitter. Our results show that these identified signals are indeed critical to help improve existing efforts to detect online radicalization."

            "We investigated which features contribute most to the classification task to distinguish between radical and non-radical tweets. We used the mean decrease impurity method of random forests BIBREF27 to identify the most important features in each feature category. The ten most important features are shown in Table TABREF22 . We found that the most important feature for distinguishing radical tweets is the psychological feature distance measure. This measures how similar the Twitter user is to the average psychological profile calculated from the propaganda magazine articles. Following this is the Us-them dichotomy which looks at the total number of pronouns used (I,they, we, you). This finding is in line with the tactics reported in the radicalization literature with regards to emphasizing the separation between the radical group and the world.",
            "Moreover, among the top contributing features are behavioural features related to the number of mentions a single user makes, and their HITS hub and authority rank among their interaction network. This relates to how active the user is in interacting with other users and how much attention they receive from their community. This links to the objectives of those radical users in spreading their ideologies and reaching out to potential like-minded people. As for the INLINEFORM0 category, we find that the use of word2vec embedding improves the performance in comparison with using the tf-idf features. Additionally, all bi-grams and tri-grams features did not contribute much to the classification; only uni-grams did. This can be related to the differences in the writing styles when constructing sentences and phrases in articles and in the social media context (especially given the limitation of the number of words allowed by the Twitter platform). Additionally, the violent word ratio, longWords, and allCaps features are among the top contributing features from this category. This finding agrees to a large extent with observations from the literature regarding dealing with similar problems, where the use of dictionaries of violent words aids with the prediction of violent extremist narrative."

For example, in our use case, thousands of new properties are added to the lodging platform's inventory each quarter.

We note that our model is not explicitly trained to learn this kind of market information. However, it is able to learn this by combining the click sessions and hotel attribute information. Figure FIGREF13 shows the average similarity scores between hotels in multiple famous cities using two of the embedding vectors. As Figure FIGREF13 clearly depicts, there is a strong similarity between hotels of the same city. Also, markets that are closer to each other (all US cities vs European vs Asian), or for reasons other than geographic proximity are expected to be more similar (e.g., Las Vegas and Macao, or Tokyo and Paris) do indeed have a higher similarity. For comparison, Figure FIGREF13 shows the average cosine similarity between and within markets for the session-only model embeddings.

Our neural network architecture extends the skip-gram model to accommodate multiple features and encode each one separately. We then fuse the sub-embeddings to predict hotels in the same session. Through experimental results, we show that enriching the neural network with supplemental, structured hotel information results in superior embeddings when compared to a model that relies solely on click information. Our final embedding can be decomposed into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding the representation for a different hotel aspect, resulting in an interpretable representation. It is also dynamic, in a sense that if one of the attributes or user ratings changes for a hotel, we can feed the updated data to the model and easily obtain a new embedding.

In this section we focus on a data-selection scenario where only a very small number of in-domain sentences are used to select data from a larger unlabeled parallel corpus. An established method for data selection was proposed by BIBREF4, which was also used in training the winning systems in WMT 2019 BIBREF39, BIBREF40. This method compares the cross-entropy, according to domain-specific and non-domain-specific language models, for each candidate sentence for selection.

Therefore, all results in this section are conducted on only a subset of the test set to keep the runtime under control. We first constrained search to translations longer than 0.25 times the source sentence length and thus excluded the empty translation from the search space. Although this mitigates the problem slightly (Fig. FIGREF16 ), it still results in a peak in the INLINEFORM1 cluster. This suggests that the problem of empty translations is the consequence of an inherent model bias towards shorter hypotheses and cannot be fixed with a length constraint."

            "Because of legal and institutional concerns arising from the sensitivity of clinical data, it is difficult for the NLP community to gain access to relevant data BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . This is especially true for the researchers not connected with a healthcare organization. Corpora with transparent access policies that are within reach of NLP researchers exist, but are few. An often used corpus is MIMICII(I) BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Despite its large size (covering over 58,000 hospital admissions), it is only representative of patients from a particular clinical domain (the intensive care in this case) and geographic location (a single hospital in the United States). Assuming that such a specific sample is representative of a larger population is an example of sampling bias (we discuss further sources of bias in section \"Social impact and biases\" ). Increasing the size of a sample without recognizing that this sample is atypical for the general population (e.g. not all patients are critical care patients) could also increase sampling bias BIBREF13 . We need more large corpora for various medical specialties, narrative types, as well as languages and geographic areas.",
            "Related to difficult access to raw clinical data is the lack of available annotated datasets for model training and benchmarking. The reality is that annotation projects do take place, but are typically constrained to a single healthcare organization. Therefore, much of the effort put into annotation is lost afterwards due to impossibility of sharing with the larger research community BIBREF6 , BIBREF14 . Again, exceptions are either few\u2014e.g. THYME BIBREF15 , a corpus annotated with temporal information\u2014or consist of small datasets resulting from shared tasks like the i2b2 and ShARe/CLEF. In addition, stringent access policies hamper reproduction efforts, impede scientific oversight and limit collaboration, not only between institutions but also more broadly between the clinical and NLP communities.",
            "There are known cases of datasets that had been used in published research (including reproduction) in its full form, like MiPACQ, Blulab, EMC Dutch Clinical Corpus and 2010 i2b2/VA BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , but were later trimmed down or made unavailable, likely due to legal issues. Even if these datasets were still available in full, their small size is still a concern, and the comments above regarding sampling bias certainly apply. For example, a named entity recognizer trained on 2010 i2b2/VA data, which consists of 841 annotated patient records from three different specialty areas, will due to its size only contain a small portion of possible named entities. Similarly, in linking clinical concepts to an ontology, where the number of output classes is larger BIBREF20 , the small amount of training data is a major obstacle to deployment of systems suitable for general use.",

As an example, around 40M clinical documents from different veterinary clinics in UK and Australia are stored centrally in the VetCompass repository.

            "Motivated by these advances in neural language modeling and affective analysis of text, in this paper we propose a model for representation and generation of emotional text, which we call the Affect-LM. Our model is trained on conversational speech corpora, common in language modeling for speech recognition applications BIBREF10 . Figure 1 provides an overview of our Affect-LM and its ability to generate emotionally colored conversational text in a number of affect categories with varying affect strengths. While these parameters can be manually tuned to generate conversational text, the affect category can also be automatically inferred from preceding context words. Specifically for model training, the affect category is derived from features generated using keyword spotting from a dictionary of emotional words, such as the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) tool BIBREF11 . Our primary research questions in this paper are:",

During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all word categories of LIWC corresponding to affective processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC. For example, the affective representation of the sentence i will fight in the war is $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}=$ {\u201csad\":0, \u201cangry\":1, \u201canxiety\":0, \u201cnegative emotion\":1, \u201cpositive emotion\":0}."

            "Affect-LM can be used to generate sentences conditioned on the input affect category, the affect strength $\\beta $ , and the context words. For our experiments, we have chosen the following affect categories - positive emotion, anger, sad, anxiety, and negative emotion (which is a superclass of anger, sad and anxiety). As described in Section \"Conclusions and Future Work\" , the affect strength $\\beta $ defines the degree of dominance of the affect-dependent energy term on the word prediction in the language model, consequently after model training we can change $\\beta $ to control the degree of how \u201cemotionally colored\" a generated utterance is, varying from $\\beta =0$ (neutral; baseline model) to $\\beta =\\infty $ (the generated sentences only consist of emotionally colored words, with no grammatical structure). When Affect-LM is used for generation, the affect categories could be either (1) inferred from the context using LIWC (this occurs when we provide sentence beginnings which are emotionally colored themselves), or (2) set to an input emotion descriptor $\\mathbf {e}$ (this is obtained by setting $\\mathbf {e}$ to a binary vector encoding the desired emotion and works even for neutral sentence beginnings). Given an initial starting set of $M$ words $w_1,w_2,...,w_M$ to complete, affect strength $\\beta $ , and the number of words $\\beta $0 to generate each $\\beta $1 -th generated word is obtained by sampling from $\\beta $2 for $\\beta $3 .",
            "Our proposed model learns a generative model of the next word $w_t$ conditioned not only on the previous words $w_1,w_2,...,w_{t-1}$ but also on the affect category $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ which is additional information about emotional content. During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all word categories of LIWC corresponding to affective processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC. For example, the affective representation of the sentence i will fight in the war is $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}=$ {\u201csad\":0, \u201cangry\":1, \u201canxiety\":0, \u201cnegative emotion\":1, \u201cpositive emotion\":0}."

It must be acknowledged that a fair comparison between the datasets is difficult to accomplish since the length of evidence and documents, as well as the annotation quality, significantly varies between the corpora.",

The corpus includes additional evidence, which has been used by fact-checkers to validate the claims, as well as metadata including the speaker ID and the date when the claim was made. This is early work in automated fact-checking and BIBREF4 mainly focused on the analysis of the task. The corpus therefore only contains 106 claims, which is not enough to train high-performing machine learning systems.",

The dataset is based on the project Emergent which is a journalist initiative for rumor debunking. It consists of 300 claims that have been validated by journalists. The corpus provides 2,595 news articles that are related to the claims. Each article is summarized into a headline and is annotated with the article's stance regarding the claim. The corpus is well suited for training stance detection systems in the news domain and it was therefore chosen in the Fake News Challenge BIBREF8 for training and evaluation of competing systems. However, the number of claims in the corpus is relatively small, thus it is unlikely that sophisticated claim validation systems can be trained using this corpus.",

The shared task was divided into two parts, stance detection and veracity prediction of the rumors, which is similar to claim validation. The large number of stance-annotated tweets allows for training stance detection systems reaching a relatively high score of about 0.78 accuracy. However, since the number of claims (rumours) is relatively small, and the corpus is only based on tweets, this dataset alone is not suitable to train generally applicable claim validation systems.",

For each claim, the authors extracted about 30 associated documents using the Google search engine, resulting in a collection of 136,085 documents.

The corpus is based on about 50k popular Wikipedia articles. Annotators modified sentences in these articles to create the claims and labeled other sentences in the articles, which support or refute the claim, as evidence. The corpus is large enough to train deep learning systems able to retrieve evidence from Wikipedia. Nevertheless, since the corpus only covers Wikipedia and the claims are created synthetically, the trained systems are unlikely to be able to extract evidence from heterogeneous web-sources and validate claims on the basis of evidence found on the Internet."

In spoken language, such as in the message-reply case, however, whole word distribution must be considered instead of considering the occurrence of several words, because the data is usually not enough than the literature case. So, we use a simple and efficient metric to measure the similarity between the user style and the output of the personalized model.",
            "An output of a personalized language model can be measured by calculating the cross entropy between the word distribution of the model output and that of the target data. Word distribution can be acquired by normalizing a word histogram which is calculated based on word counts in the target corpus. Equation (3) shows the metric formulation."

It shows the similarity between the personalized model output and the target corpus as the number of training epoch increasing. The general model was pre-trained with the \u201cFriends\u201d corpus and the \u201cChandler\u201d corpus was used training personalized model. Each Model is selected from various training epoch (0, 10, 20 and 40) and schemes, and test messages of 753 are used for the reply generation with the selected model used. As the table shows, the cross entropy measure has the highest value when the target corpus is the \u201cbible\u201d as expected because it is written in different style than dialogues in drama script. For the drama script case, the cross entropy measured with the \u201cchandler\" corpus shows the lowest value among schemes. This result reveals that the personalized language model is trained properly from the general language model. Thus it is more similar in style to the target data corpus than the general language model. The \u201cepoch 0\" case means the initial model state trained from general language corpus, \u201cfriends\" corpus. Thus cross entropy with \u201cfriends\" target corpus shows lower value than that of \u201cchandler\" and \u201cbible\" target corpus cases."

            "Similar to BCF, BayesCat is a knowledge-lean acquisition model which can be straightforwardly applied to input from different languages. It induces categories $z$ which are represented through a distribution over target concepts $c$ , $p(c|z)$ , and a distribution over features $f$ (i.e., individual context words), $p(f|z)$ . BayesCat, like BCF, is a Bayesian model and its parameters are inferred using approximate MCMC inference, in the form of a Gibbs sampler. Unlike BCF, however, BayesCat does not induce structured feature representations, and comparing it to BCF allows us to evaluate the advantage of joint category and feature learning. BayesCat induces categories represented through unstructured bags-of-features. As such, the model structure of BayesCat is closely related to topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; BIBREF57 ). Comparing our proposed model against BayesCat allows us to shed light on the benefit of more sophisticated model structure which allows to learn features jointly with categories, compared to the information that can be captured in vanilla topic models. For our human evaluation in Section \"Experiment 3: Feature Relevance and Coherence\" we construct feature types from BayesCat features as follows. First we represent each feature $f$ as its probability under each category $p(z|f)$ . Based on this representation, we again employ $k$ -means clustering to group features into $G$ global feature types $g$ . Finally, we compute category-featuretype associations as:",
            "Table 3 displays the results for all five languages. BCF learns categories which most closely resemble the human gold standard, and both BCF and the co-occurrence model clearly outperform the random baseline. The Bayesian models, BCF and BayesCat, outperform the co-occurrence model across metrics and languages. For English, Strudel slightly outperforms BCF. Note, however, that, BCF learns the categories from data, whereas for Strudel we construct the categories post-hoc after a highly informed feature extraction process (relying on syntactic patterns). It is therefore not surprising that Strudel performs well, and it is encouraging to see that BCF learns categories of comparable quality."

            "Given their prevalent function in human cognition, the acquisition and representation of categories has attracted considerable attention in cognitive science, and numerous theories have emerged BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Empirical studies of category acquisition and representation, have been predominantly based on small-scale laboratory experiments. In a typical experiment, human subjects are presented with small sets of often artificial concepts, such as binary strings BIBREF14 or colored shapes BIBREF15 , with strictly controlled features BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Hypotheses and principles of human categorization are established based on the processes and characteristics of the categorizations produced by the participants. The distribution of subjects participating in such studies is often skewed towards members of cultural and socioeconomic groups which are prevalent in the environment where the research is conducted, and typically consists to a large proportion of western, educated, wealthy and English-speaking participants often sampled from the even more specific population of college students. The demographic and socioeconomic bias has been long recognized, and the question of how this bias might impact conclusions about human cognition in general BIBREF19 and category learning specifically is under active debate BIBREF9 . Although laboratory studies are invaluable for understanding categorization phenomena in a controlled environment, they are also expensive and time-consuming to conduct, and consequently problematic to scale."

Our approach allows performing fast ASR domain adaptation by providing a library of intent examples used for lattice rescoring. The method guides the best lattice path selection process by increasing the probability of intent recognition. At the same time, the method does not rescore paths of unessential turns which do not contain intent examples. As a result, our approach improves the understanding of spontaneous conversations by recognizing semantically important transcription segments while adding minimal computational overhead. Our method is domain agnostic and can be easily adapted to a new one by providing the library of intent examples expected to appear in the new domain.

            "BIBREF49 describe in their work the creation of the Open Multilingual Wordnet and its extension with other resources BIBREF50 . The resource is made by combining different wordnets together, knowledge from Wiktionary and the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. Overall they obtained over 2 million senses for over 100 thousand concepts, linking over 1.4 million words in hundreds of languages. Since using existing lexical resources guarantees a high precision, it may also provide a low recall due to the limitedness of lexical resources in different languages and domains. A different approach to expand English WordNet synsets with lexicalizations in other languages was proposed in BIBREF51 . The authors do not directly match concepts in the two different language resources, but demonstrate an approach that learns how to determine the best translation for English synsets by taking bilingual dictionaries, structural information of the English WordNet and corpus frequency information into account. With the growing amount of parallel data, BIBREF52 show an approach to acquire a set of synsets from parallel corpora. The synsets are obtained by comparing aligned words in parallel corpora in several languages. Similarly, the sloWNet for Slovene BIBREF53 and Wolf for French BIBREF12 are constructed using a multilingual corpus and word alignment techniques in combination with other existing lexical resources. Since all these approaches use word alignment information, they are not able to generate any translation equivalents for multi-word expressions (MWE). In contrast, our approach use an SMT system trained on a large amount of parallel sentences, which allows us to align possible MWEs, such as commercial loan or take a breath, between source and target language. Furthermore, we engage the idea of identifying relevant contextual information to support an SMT system translating short expressions, which showed better performance compared to approaches without a context. BIBREF54 built small domain-specific translation models for ontology translation from relevant sentence pairs that were identified in a parallel corpus based on the ontology labels to be translated. With this approach they improve the translation quality over the usage of large generic translation models. Since the generation of translation models can be computational expensive, BIBREF55 use large generic translation models to translate ontology labels, which were placed into a disambiguated context. With this approach the authors demonstrate translation quality improvement over commercial systems, like Microsoft Translator. Different from this approach, which uses the hierarchical structure of the ontology for disambiguation, we engage a large number of different languages to identify the relevant context.",
            "BIBREF56 present a method for WordNet construction and enlargement with the help of sense tagged parallel corpora. Since parallel sense tagged data are not always available, they use Google Translate to translate a manually sense tagged corpus. In addition they apply automatic sense tagging of a manually translated parallel corpus, whereby they report worse performance compared to the previous approach. We try to overcome this issue by engaging up to ten languages to improve the performance of the automatic sense tagging. Similarly, BabelNet BIBREF5 aligns the lexicographic knowledge from WordNet to the encyclopaedic knowledge of Wikipedia. This is done by assigning WordNet synsets to Wikipedia entries, and making these relations multilingual through the interlingual links. For languages, which do not have the corresponding Wikipedia entry, the authors use Google Translate to translate English sentences containing the synset in the sense annotated corpus. After that, the most frequent translation is included as a variant for the synset for the given language."

This means that the previous partial identifications have weights of INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 , INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 , respectively. As a result, two extractors will have the same performance even if one identifies the complete named entity `Jogos Ol\u00edmpicos de Atlanta 1996' and the other splits it into two named entities, `Atlanta 1996' and `Jogos Ol\u00edmpicos'."

This simply reflects the fact that data drawn from Twitter and web pages will likely represent people from different places. Why? We have also seen that Twitter data matches populations better when population numbers are weighted by GDP and worse when weighted by internet-usage statistics. This implies that Twitter as a platform represents more wealthy populations than general web-crawled data. An alternate interpretation is that the Twitter collection here is based on urban areas, which tend to have more wealthy populations.

That is a secondary problem in this context because the goal is to develop ground-truth population-centered baselines that could be used to evaluate different Twitter collection methods.",

Since the SAMSum corpus contains dialogues created by linguists, the question arises whether such conversations are really similar to those typically written via messenger apps. To find the answer, we performed a validation task. We asked two linguists to doubly annotate 50 conversations in order to verify whether the dialogues could appear in a messenger app and could be summarized (i.e. a dialogue is not too general or unintelligible) or not (e.g. a dialogue between two people in a shop). The results revealed that 94% of examined dialogues were classified by both annotators as good i.e. they do look like conversations from a messenger app and could be condensed in a reasonable way. In a similar validation task, conducted for the existing dialogue-type datasets (described in the Initial approach section), the annotators agreed that only 28% of the dialogues resembled conversations from a messenger app."

            "Alzantot et al. BIBREF20 proposed a black-box targeted attack using a population-based optimization via genetic algorithm BIBREF21. The perturbation procedure consists of random selection of words, finding their nearest neighbours, ranking and substitution to maximize the probability of target category. In this method, random word selection in the sequence to substitute were full of uncertainties and might be meaningless for the target label when changed. Since our model focuses on black-box non-targeted attack using an encoder-decoder approach, our work is closely related to the following techniques in the literature: Wong (2017) BIBREF22, Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 and Gao et al. BIBREF24. Wong (2017) BIBREF22 proposed a GAN-inspired method to generate adversarial text examples targeting black-box classifiers. However, this approach was restricted to binary text classifiers. Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 crafted adversarial examples using their proposed Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Networks (SCPNs). They designed this model for generating syntactically adversarial examples without compromising on the quality of the input semantics. The general process is based on the encoder-decoder architecture of SCPN. Gao et al. BIBREF24 implemented an algorithm called DeepWordBug that generates small text perturbations in a black box setting forcing the deep learning model to make mistakes. DeepWordBug used a scoring function to determine important tokens and then applied character-level transformations to those tokens. Though the algorithm successfully generates adversarial examples by introducing character-level attacks, most of the introduced perturbations are constricted to misspellings. The semantics of the text may be irreversibly changed if excessive misspellings are introduced to fool the target classifier. While SCPNs and DeepWordBug primary rely only on paraphrases and character transformations respectively to fool the classifier, our model uses a hybrid word-character encoder-decoder approach to introduce both paraphrases and character-level perturbations as a part of our attack strategy. Our attacks can be a test of how robust the text classification models are to word and character-level perturbations.",

The encoder extracts the character and word information from the input text and produces hidden representations of words considering its sequence context information. A substitute network is not implemented separately but applied using an attention mechanism to weigh the encoded hidden states based on their relevance to making predictions closer to target model outputs. The attention scores provide certain level of interpretability to the model as the regions of text that need to perturbed can be identified and visualized. The decoder uses the attention scores obtained from the substitute network, combines it with decoder state information to decide if perturbation is required at this state or not and finally emits the text unit (a text unit may refer to a word or character). Inspired by a work by Luong et al. BIBREF25, the decoder is a word and character-level recurrent network employed to generate adversarial examples. Before the substitute network is trained, we pretrain our encoder-decoder model on common misspellings and paraphrase datasets to empower the model to produce character and word perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases. For training substitute network and generation of adversarial examples, we randomly draw data that is disjoint from the training data of the black-box model since we assume the adversaries have no prior knowledge about the training data or the model. Specifically, we consider attacking a target classifier by generating adversarial examples based on unseen input examples. This is done by dividing the dataset into training, validation and test using 60-30-10 ratio. The training data is used by the target model, while the unseen validation samples are used with necessary data augmentation for our AEG model.

Since we do not have access to gradients or parameters of the target model, we modelled our problem using a reinforcement learning based approach. In order to effectively baseline the REINFORCE algorithm for policy-gradients, we implemented a self-critical approach that normalizes the rewards obtained by sampled sentences with the rewards obtained by the model under test-time inference algorithm. By generating adversarial examples for target word and character-based models trained on IMDB reviews and AG's news dataset, we find that our model is capable of generating semantics-preserving perturbations that leads to steep decrease in accuracy of those target models. We conducted ablation studies to find the importance of individual components of our system. Extremely low values of the certain reward coefficient constricts the quantitative performance of the model can also lead to semantic divergence. Therefore, the choice of a particular value for this model should be motivated by the demands of the context in which it is applied. One of the main challenges of such approaches lies in the ability to produce more synthetic data to train the generator model in the distribution of the target model's training data. This can significantly improve the performance of our model.

Bakshy et al. investigated the role of weak ties in information diffusion, through resharing of URLs on Facebook BIBREF38 . They found that URLs shared across strong ties are more likely to be reshared. However, they also found that weak ties play an important role, because users tend to have more weak ties than strong ties, and because weak ties are more likely to be a source of new information. In some respects, language change is similar to traditional information diffusion scenarios, such as resharing of URLs.

We hypothesize that, if a domain-pair $(D_1,D_2)$ shares a larger number of significant words than the pair $(D_1,D_3)$, then $D_1$ is closer to $D_2$ as compared to $D_3$, since they use relatively higher number of similar words for sentiment expression.

SF coverage provides a measure of the extent of supporting facts used for question generation. For the first two modalities, evaluators are asked to rate the performance of the question generator on a 1\u20135 scale (5 for the best).

We refer to these relevant sentences as supporting facts in the context. Hence, we frame Multi-hop question generation as the task of generating the question conditioned on the information gathered from reasoning over all the supporting facts across multiple paragraphs/documents. Since this task requires assembling and summarizing information from multiple relevant documents in contrast to a single sentence/paragraph, therefore, it is more challenging than the existing single-hop QG task. Further, the presence of irrelevant information makes it difficult to capture the supporting facts required for question generation. The explicit information about the supporting facts in the document is not often readily available, which makes the task more complex. In this work, we provide an alternative to get the supporting facts information from the document with the help of multi-task learning. Table TABREF1 gives sample examples from SQuAD and HotPotQA dataset.

Our key idea is to first train a high-resource language pair, then use the resulting trained network (the parent model) to initialize and constrain training for our low-resource language pair (the child model). We find that we can optimize our results by fixing certain parameters of the parent model, letting the rest be fine-tuned by the child model. We report NMT improvements from transfer learning of 5.6 Bleu on average, and we provide an analysis of why the method works. The final NMT system approaches strong SBMT baselines in in all four language pairs, and exceeds SBMT performance in one of them. Furthermore, we show that NMT is an exceptional re-scorer of `traditional' MT output; even NMT that on its own is worse than SBMT is consistently able to improve upon SBMT system output when incorporated as a re-scoring model.",

The parent model trained on a large amount of bilingual data can be considered an anchor point, the peak of our prior distribution in model space. When we train the child model initialized with the parent model, we fix parameters likely to be useful across tasks so that they will not be changed during child-model training. In the French-English to Uzbek-English example, as a result of the initialization, the English word embeddings from the parent model are copied, but the Uzbek words are initially mapped to random French embeddings. The English embeddings should be kept but the Uzbek embeddings should be modified during training of the child model. Freezing certain portions of the parent model and fine tuning others can be considered a hard approximation to a tight prior or strong regularization applied to some of the parameters. We also experiment with ordinary L2 regularization, but find it does not significantly improve over the parameter freezing described above."

In our empirical comparison, we found that although both methods mitigate direct gender bias and maintain the interpretability of the space, WED failed to maintain a robust representation of gender (the best variants had an error rate of 23% average when drawing non-biased analogies, suggesting that too much gender information was removed). A new variant of CDA we propose (the Names Intervention) is the only to successfully mitigate indirect gender bias: following its application, previously biased words are significantly less clustered according to gender, with an average of 49% reduction in cluster purity when clustering the most biased words. We also proposed Counterfactual Data Substitution, which generally performed better than the CDA equivalents, was notably quicker to compute (as Word2Vec is linear in corpus size), and in theory allows for multiple intervention layers without a corpus becoming exponentially large."

            "We fixedly associate pairs of names for swapping, thus expanding BIBREF5's short list of gender pairs vastly. Clearly both name frequency and the degree of gender-specificity are relevant to this bipartite matching. If only frequency were considered, a more gender-neutral name (e.g. Taylor) could be paired with a very gender-specific name (e.g. John), which would negate the gender intervention in many cases (namely whenever a male occurrence of Taylor is transformed into John, which would also result in incorrect pronouns, if present). If, on the other hand, only the degree of gender-specificity were considered, we would see frequent names (like James) being paired with far less frequent names (like Sybil), which would distort the overall frequency distribution of names. This might also result in the retention of a gender signal: for instance, swapping a highly frequent male name with a rare female name might simply make the rare female name behave as a new link between masculine contexts (instead of the original male name), as it rarely appears in female contexts."

The second, the Names Intervention, is a method which can be applied to either CDA or CDS, and treats bias inherent in first names. It does so using a novel name pairing strategy that accounts for both name frequency and gender-specificity.

Inspired by SpecAgument BIBREF3 and BERT BIBREF4, we propose a semantic mask approach to improve the strength of the language modeling power in the attention-based E2E model, which, at the same time, improves the generalization capacity of the model as well. Like SpecAugment, this approach masks out partial of the acoustic features during model training. However, instead of using a random mask as in SpecAugment, our approach masks out the whole patch of the features corresponding to an output token during training, e.g., a word or a word-piece. The motivation is to encourage the model to fill in the missing token (or correct the semantic error) based on the contextual information with less acoustic evidence, and consequently, the model may have a stronger language modeling power and is more robust to acoustic distortions."

            "Sentiment Analysis is considered as the automated analysis of sentiments, emotions or opinions expressed in texts towards certain entities BIBREF0 . The proliferation of online commerce and customer feedback has significantly motivated companies to invest in intelligent text analysis tools and technologies where sentiment analysis plays a crucial role. There have traditionally been two main approaches to sentiment analysis. The first one uses unsupervised algorithms, sentiment lexicons and word similarity measures to mine emotions in raw texts. The second uses emotionally-labeled text datasets to train supervised (or deep supervised) algorithms and use them to predict emotions in other documents. Naturally, most of sentiment analysis research has been conducted for the English language. Chinese BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 and Spanish BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 have also received a considerable extra attention in the last years. Smaller languages like Czech have seen fewer efforts in this aspect. It is thus much easier to find online data resources for English than for other languages BIBREF6 . One of the first attempts to create sentiment annotated resources of Czech texts dates back in 2012 BIBREF7 . Authors released three datasets of news articles, movie reviews, and product reviews. A subsequent work consisted in creating a Czech dataset of information technology product reviews, their aspects and customers' attitudes towards those aspects BIBREF8 . This latter dataset is an essential basis for performing aspect-based sentiment analysis experiments BIBREF9 . Another available resource is a dataset of ten thousand Czech Facebook posts and the corresponding emotional labels BIBREF10 . The authors report various experimental results with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME) classifiers. Despite the creation of the resources mentioned above and the results reported by the corresponding authors, there is still little evidence about the performance of various techniques and algorithms on sentiment analysis of Czech texts. In this paper, we perform an empirical survey, probing many popular supervised learning algorithms on sentiment prediction of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We perform document-level analysis considering the text part (that is usually short) as a single document and explore various parameters of Tf-Idf vectorizer and each classification algorithms reporting the optimal ones. According to our results, SVM (Support Vector Machine) is the best player, shortly followed by Logistic Regression (LR) and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB). Moreover, we observe that ensemble techniques like Random Forests (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) or voting schemes do not increase the performance of the basic classifiers. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section \"Czech Facebook Dataset\" presents some details and statistics about the two Czech datasets we used. Section \"PREPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION\" describes the text preprocessing steps and vectorizer parameters we grid-searched. Section \"SUPERVISED ALGORITHMS\" presents in details the grid-searched parameters and values of all classifiers. In Section \"RESULTS\" , we report the optimal parameter values and test scores in each dataset. Finally, Section \"CONCLUSIONS\" concludes and presents possible future contributions.",
            "Czech Facebook dataset was created by collecting posts from popular Facebook pages in Czech BIBREF10 . The ten thousand records were independently revised by two annotators. Two other annotators were involved in cases of disagreement. To estimate inter-annotator agreement, they used Cohen's kappa coefficient which was about 0.66. Each post was labeled as negative, neutral or positive. There were yet a few samples that revealed both negative and positive sentiments and were marked as bipolar. Same as the authors in their paper, we removed the bipolar category from our experimental set to avoid ambiguity and used the remaining 9752 samples. A few data samples are illustrated in Figure 1 .",

The reviews are evaluative in nature (users apprising items they bought) and were categorized as negative or positive only. Some minor problems they carry are the grammatical or typing errors that frequently appear in their texts BIBREF11 . In Table 1 we present some rounded statistics about the two datasets. As we can see, Mall product reviews are slightly longer (13 vs. 10 tokens) than Czech Facebook posts. We also see that the number of data samples in each sentiment category are unbalanced in both cases. A few samples of Mall reviews are illustrated in Figure 2 ."

            "In this paper, we tried various supervised learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech texts using two existing datasets of Facebook posts and Mall product reviews. We grid-searched various parameters of Tf-Idf vectorizer and each of the machine learning algorithms. According to our observations, best sentiment predictions are achieved when bigrams are added, Czech stop words are not removed and l2 normalization is applied in vectorization. We also reported the optimal parameter values of each explored classifier which can serve as guidelines for other researchers. The accuracy and F $_1$ scores on the test part of each dataset indicate that the best-performing algorithms are Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Na\u00efve Bayes. Their simplicity and speed make them optimal choices for sentiment analysis of texts in cases when few thousands of sentiment-labeled data samples are available. We also observed that ensemble methods like bagging (e.g., Random Forest), boosting (e.g., AdaBoost) or even voting ensemble schemes do not add value to any of the three basic classifiers. This is probably because all Tf-Idf vectorized features are relevant and necessary for the classification process and extra combinations of their subsets are not able to further improve classification performance. Finally, as future work, we would like to create additional labeled datasets with texts of other languages and perform similar sentiment analysis experiments. That way, valuable metalinguistic insights could be drawn and reported."

            "Batch size is regarded as a significant factor influencing deep learning models from the various CV studies detailed in Section SECREF1. It is well known to CV researchers that a large batch size is often associated with a poor test accuracy. However, the trend is reversed when the CLR policy is introduced by BIBREF22. The critical question is: does this trend of using larger batch size with CLR hold for training transformers in NMT? Furthermore, what range of batch size does the associated regularization becomes significant? This will have implications because if CLR allows using a larger batch size without compromising the generalization capability, then it will allow training speed up by using a larger batch size. From Figure FIGREF20, we see that the trend of CLR with a larger batch size for NMT training does indeed lead to better performance. Thus the phenomenon we observe in BIBREF22 for CV tasks can be carried across to NMT. In fact, using a small batch size of 256 (the green curve in Figure FIGREF20) leads to divergence, as shown by the validation loss spiraling out of control. This is in line with the need to prevent over regularization when using CLR; in this case, the small batch size of 256 adds a strong regularization effect and thus need to be avoided. This larger batch size effect afforded by CLR is certainly good news because NMT typically deals with large networks and huge datasets. The benefit of a larger batch size afforded by CLR means that training time can be cut down considerably."

To craft these features we use SentiwordNet BIBREF5 , we create sentiment and subjective score per word in each sentences. SentiwordNet is the result of the automatic annotation of all the synsets of WORDNET according to the notions of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. Each synset s in WORDNET is associated to three numerical scores Pos(s), Neg(s), and Obj(s) which indicate how positive, negative, and objective (i.e., neutral) the terms contained in the synset are. Different senses of the same term may thus have different opinion-related properties. These scores are presented per sentence and their lengths are equal to the length of each sentence. In case that the score is not available, we used a fixed score 0.001.",

We use NRC Emotion Lexicon BIBREF6 with 8 emotion tags (e.i. joy, trust, anticipation, surprise, anger, fear, sadness, disgust). We demonstrate the presence of emotion words as an 8 dimension feature, presenting all 8 emotion categories of the NRC lexicon. Each feature represent one emotion category, where 0.001 indicates of absent of the emotion and 1 indicates the presence of the emotion. The advantage of this feature is their portability in transferring emotion learning across genres."

Results in Fig. FIGREF19 demonstrates that topics related to politics, technology or culture are more discussed by people with higher income, while other topics associated to slang, insults or informal abbreviations are more used by people of lower income. These observable differences between the average income of people, who use (or not) words from discriminative topics, demonstrates well the potential of word topic clustering used as features for the inference of SES. All in all, each user in our dataset was assigned with a 1117 feature vector encoding the lexical and semantic profile she displayed on Twitter. We did not apply any further feature selection as the distribution of importance of features appeared rather smooth (not shown here). It did not provided evident ways to identify a clear set of particularly determinant features, but rather indicated that the combination of them were important."

For validation, we took users from each annotated SES class and computed the distribution of their incomes inferred from the IRIS census data (see Section SECREF6 ).

Not surprisingly, these two curves were strongly correlated as indicated by the high Pearson correlation coefficients summarized in the last column of Table 3 which, again, assured us that our geolocated sample of Twitter users was representative of the whole set of users. At the same time, the temporal variability of these curves suggested that people tweeting during the day used a more standard language than those users who are more active during the night. However, after measuring the average income of active users in a given hour over a week, we obtained an even more sophisticated picture. It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier). This explanation was supported by the high coefficients (summarized in Table 3 ), which were indicative of strong and significant correlations between the temporal variability of average linguistic variables and average income of the active population on Twitter."

Evaluation of our methods pointed to the existence of semantic and linguistic differences between fake news and satire. In particular, both methods achieved a significantly better performance than the baseline language-based method.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of female workers with the frequency of female translations, finding no correlation between said variables. Our data shows that Google Translate outputs fail to reflect the real-world distribution of female workers, under-estimating the expected frequency. That is to say that even if we do not expect a 50:50 distribution of translated gender pronouns, Google Translate exhibits male defaults in a greater frequency that job occupation data alone would suggest.

For example, while the words 'happems' and 'ocures' are both incorrectly spelled versions of 'happens' and 'occurs' respectively, our embedding exhibits a high cosine similarity between the word vectors of the correct and incorrect versions. The embedding we created was an embedding into 200 dimensional space with a vocabulary consisting of 1.12 million words. Using spelling dictionaries we approximate that the percentage of correctly spelled words in the vocabulary of this embedding is approximately 7%, or roughly 80,000 words, while the remaining 93% are either misspellings, made up words or words from other languages. Lastly, due to the prevalence of words that are concatenated (due to a missing space), we split up any word with a Levenstein distance that is greater than two from our vocabulary into smaller words that are in the vocabulary. This ensures that any sentence is tokenized into a list of elements, almost all of which have valid embeddings."

            "In this paper we presented a novel architecture for NER that expands the feature set space based on feature clustering of images and texts, focused on microblogs. Due to their terse nature, such noisy data often lack enough context, which poses a challenge to the correct identification of named entities. To address this issue we have presented and evaluated a novel approach using the Ritter dataset, showing consistent results over state-of-the-art models without using any external resource or encoded rule, achieving an average of 0.59 F1. The results slightly outperformed state-of-the-art models which do not rely on encoded rules (0.49 and 0.54 F1), suggesting the viability of using the produced metadata to also boost existing NER approaches. A further important contribution is the ability to handle single tokens and misspelled words successfully, which is of utmost importance in order to better understand short texts. Finally, the architecture of the approach and its indicators introduce potential to transparently support multilingual data, which is the subject of ongoing investigation."

            "ResNet BIBREF8 solves many problems in training very deep CNNs. The key ResNet innovation is the shortcut connections shown in Figure FIGREF1. Figure FIGREF1 is a typical building block of ResNet. The input to the block, $x$, will go through both the original mapping $F(x)$ (weight layers, RELU activations and batch normalization BIBREF3) and the identity shortcut connection. The output, $y$, will be $F(x)+x$. The authors of BIBREF8 hypothesize that the so-called residual mapping of $y=F(x)+x$ should be easier to optimize than the original mapping of $y=F(x)$. The design of the special building block is motivated by the observation in BIBREF6, BIBREF7 that accuracy degrades when more layers are stacked onto an already very deep CNN model. If the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, the deeper model should not have worse training error than the original shallower model without these added layers. The degradation actually suggests that the optimizer has difficulties in approximating identity mappings. With the identity shortcut connections in the ResNet building block, the optimizer can simply drive the layer weights toward zero to make the block identity mapping. ResNet-style CNNs have maintained state-of-the-art results and have inspired other model structures BIBREF9, BIBREF14.",

BN is designed to reduce internal covariate shift, defined as the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in network parameters, during training. This ensures better and faster convergence of the training process. BN is achieved by whitening the input of each layer, but full whitening of each layer\u2019s inputs is costly and not differentiable everywhere. Instead of whitening the features in layer inputs and outputs jointly, each scalar feature is normalized independently to zero mean and unit variance. For a layer with d-dimensional input $x = (x(1) . . . x(d))$, each dimension will be normalized as:",

We randomly partitioned the fact/feel responses into three subsets: a training set with 70% of the data (2,426 fact and 1,667 feeling posts), a development (tuning) set with 20% of the data (693 fact and 476 feeling posts), and a test set with 10% of the data (347 fact and 239 feeling posts).

We also calculated hit rates with 10,000 candidates (instead of 20), a setup more similar to the interactive setting where there may be many candidates that could be valid responses.

The task-specific semantic composition function is generated by the meta-network. Then the task-specific composition function is used to obtain the task-specific representation of a text sequence. The difference between two sharing schemes is shown in Figure 1 . Specifically, we use two LSTMs as meta and basic (task-specific) network respectively. The meta LSTM is shared for all the tasks. The parameters of the basic LSTM are generated based on the current context by the meta LSTM, therefore the composition function is not only task-specific but also position-specific.

Experimenting with the data-yahoo-fin-dj dataset, Mehdad and Tetreault mehdad investigated whether character-level features are more indicative of abuse than word-level ones.

We analysed the top 50 errors based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the test dataset specifically to examine the number of sentences containing more than one aspect. Our investigation shows that no one system is better at predicting the sentiment of sentences that have more than one aspect (i.e. company) within them. Within those top 50 errors we found that the BLSTM systems do not know which parts of the sentence are associated to the company the sentiment is with respect to. Also they do not know the strength/existence of certain sentiment words."

We have presented the first (to our knowledge) systematic comparison of these methods. We showed notable variation in the performance of approaches across a range of evaluations. Among other conclusions, we found that the optimal approach depends critically on whether representations will be applied in supervised or unsupervised settings - in the latter case, fast, shallow BOW models can still achieve the best performance. Further, we proposed two new objectives, FastSent and Sequential Denoising Autoencoders, which perform particularly well on specific tasks (MSRP and SICK sentence relatedness respectively). If the application is unknown, however, the best all round choice may be DictRep: learning a mapping of pre-trained word embeddings from the word-phrase signal in dictionary definitions. While we have focused on models using naturally-occurring training data, in future work we will also consider supervised architectures (including convolutional, recursive and character-level models), potentially training them on multiple supervised tasks as an alternative way to induce the 'general knowledge' needed to give language technology the elusive human touch."

We find that neither M-BERT model improves on the previous state of the art for any of the three resources, with results ranging 0.1-0.8% points below the best previously published results. By contrast, both language-specific models outperform the previous state of the art, with absolute improvements for FinBERT cased ranging between 0.4 and 1.7% points. While these improvements over the already very high reference results are modest in absolute terms, the relative reductions in errors are notable: in particular, the FinBERT cased error rate on FTB is less than half of the best CoNLL'18 result BIBREF22. We also note that the uncased models are surprisingly competitive with their cased equivalents for a task where capitalization has long been an important feature: for example, FinBERT uncased performance is within approx. 0.1% points of FinBERT cased for all corpora.",

For online discussion, the differences are much more pronounced, with M-BERT models performing closer to the FastText baseline than to FinBERT. Here the language-specific BERT outperforms the multilingual by over 20% points for the smallest training data and maintains a 5% point absolute advantage even with 100,000 training examples, halving the error rate of the multilingual model for the smallest training set and maintaining an over 20% relative reduction for the largest."

Crucially, incorporating the context avoids the obvious limitations stemming from the one-vector-per-unique-word assumption inherent to the previous word embedding methods. The current successful wave of work proposing and applying different contextualized word embeddings was launched with ELMo BIBREF0, a context embedding method based on bidirectional LSTM networks. Another notable example is the ULMFit model BIBREF8, which specifically focuses on techniques for domain adaptation of LSTM-based language models. Following the introduction of the attention-based (as opposed to recurrent) Transformer architecture BIBREF9, BERT was proposed by BIBREF2, demonstrating superior performance on a broad array of tasks. The BERT model has been further refined in a number of follow-up studies BIBREF10, BIBREF11 and, presently, BERT and related models form the de facto standard approach to embedding text segments as well as individual words in context."

Our experiments show that the dependency tree-based model can predict the TED talk ratings with slightly higher performance (average F-score 0.77) than the word sequence model (average F-score 0.76). To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance in the literature on predicting the TED talk ratings. We compare the performances of these two models with a baseline of classical machine learning techniques using hand-engineered features. We find that the neural networks largely outperform the classical methods. We believe this gain in performance is achieved by the networks' ability to capture better the natural relationship of the words (as compared to the hand engineered feature selection approach in the baseline methods) and the correlations among different rating labels."

These claims are supported for example by the annual Gallup poll that ranks states from most happy to least happy BIBREF4 , or the work by Csikszentmihalyi and Hunter BIBREF5 that showed reported happiness varies significantly by day of week and time of day. We believe these factors manifest themselves in sentiments expressed in tweets and that by accounting for these factors, we can improve sentiment classification on Twitter."

Using factor analysis, it is possible to extract low-dimensional total variability factors, called i-vectors, that provide a powerful and compact representation of speech segments BIBREF23, BIBREF25, BIBREF26. In their work, Hauptman et. al. BIBREF1 have noted that using i-vectors, that model the total variability space and total speaker variability, produces a representation that also includes information about speech disorders.

One possible justification, is the fact that the PSD corpus includes tasks - such as spontaneous speech - that do not match the read sentences included in the corpus used to train the i-vector and x-vector extractors.

It is also possible to notice that x-vectors and i-vectors achieve very similar results, albeit x-vectors present a small improvement at the segment level, whereas i-vectors achieve slightly better results at the speaker level. A possible interpretation is the fact that, while x-vectors provide stronger representations for short segments, some works have shown that i-vectors may perform better when considering longer segments BIBREF8.

Specifically, we use a smaller version of our base model (with dimensions set to 64) and incorporate the user and product attributes using nine different approaches: (1) bias-attention: the bias-based method injected to the attention mechanism, (2-5) the matrix-based method injected to four different locations (matrix-embedding, matrix-encoder, matrix-attention, matrix-classifier), and (6-9) the CHIM-based method injected to four different locations (CHIM-embedding, CHIM-encoder, CHIM-attention, CHIM-classifier). We then calculate the accuracy of each approach for all datasets.",
            "Results are shown in Figure FIGREF25. The figure shows that bias-attention consistently performs poorly compared to other approaches. As expected, matrix-based representations perform the worst when injected to embeddings and encoder, however we can already see improvements over bias-attention when these representations are injected to attention and classifier. This is because the number of parameters used in the the weight matrices of attention and classifier are relatively smaller compared to those of embeddings and encoder, thus they are easier to optimize. The CHIM-based representations perform the best among other approaches, where CHIM-embedding garners the highest accuracy across datasets. Finally, even when using a better representation method, CHIM-attention consistently performs the worst among CHIM-based representations. This shows that attention mechanism is not the optimal location to inject attributes."

The question \u201cwhere is the best location to inject attributes?\u201d remains unanswered, since different tasks and settings produce different best models. That is, CHIM-embedding achieves the best accuracy while CHIM-classifier achieves the best RMSE on sentiment classification. Moreover, CHIM-encoder produces the most transferable attribute encoding for both product category classification and review headline generation. The suggestion then is to conduct experiments on all locations and check which one is best for the task at hand."

            "Our work here focuses on the zero-shot translation aspect of universal multilingual NMT. First, we attempt to investigate the relationship of encoder representation and ZS performance. By modifying the Transformer architecture of BIBREF10 to afford a fixed-size representation for the encoder output, we found that we can significantly improve zero-shot performance at the cost of a lower performance on the supervised language pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence showing that the multilingual model can capture both language-independent and language-dependent features, and that the former can be prioritized during training.",
            "This observation leads us to the most important contribution in this work, which is to propose several techniques to learn a joint semantic space for different languages in multilingual models without any architectural modification. The key idea is to prefer a source language-independent representation in the decoder using an additional loss function. As a result, the NMT architecture remains untouched and the technique is scalable to the number of languages in the training data. The success of this method is shown by significant gains on zero-shot translation quality in the standard IWSLT 2017 multilingual benchmark BIBREF11 . Finally, we introduce a more challenging scenario that involves more than one bridge language between source and target languages. This challenging setup confirms the consistency of our zero-shot techniques while clarifying the disadvantages of pivot-based translation."

One drawback of the memory enhanced model is that training was significantly slower. For this reason, model simplification is required in the future to make it more practical. In addition, the NTM has a lot of parameters and some of them may be redundant or damaging. In the DNTM-S system, we may not need to access the NTM at each step of decoding either. Instead, it can be accessed in some intervals of time steps, and the output is used for all steps within the interval.",

This feature likely improved performance of the HRED in comparison to other systems, such as the vanilla sequence-to-sequence. However, in separate experiments, GloVe vectors only managed a 5% coverage of all words in the vocabulary. This low number is likely due to the fact that the Ubuntu Dialogues corpus contains heavy terminology from the Ubuntu operating system and user packages. In addition, the Ubuntu conversations contain a significant amount of typos and grammar errors, further complicating analysis.

In fact, performing the nearest neighbor classification INLINEFORM0 with only top-10 most polarizing topics led to improvements in classification accuracy from INLINEFORM1 to INLINEFORM2 suggesting that with more data, better INLINEFORM3 representations could be learned that are better at discriminating between different ideologies."

For two data-to-text generation methods CCDT and HEDT, the latter one is consistently better than the former, which verifies the proposed hierarchical record encoder is more powerful. However, their Style BLEU scores are particularly low, which demonstrates that direct supervised learning is incapable of controlling the text expression. In comparison, our proposed models achieve better Style BLEU and Content Selection F%.

From Table 3, we can see that the Content Fidelity and Style Preservation results are highly consistent with the results of the objective evaluation.

This means that, based on the cosine similarity scores - the networks edge weights, the algorithm clusters similar sentences together in a same community while the algorithm proceeds maximizing the connectivity strength amongst the nodes in each community. The network constructed with no threshold in place was detected to have 18 distinct communities with three single node communities. Based on the visualized network (see Figure.FIGREF13), it seemed that the network community detection method clustered the sentence network as good as the original data set with human labeled classes although the communities do not look quite distinct. However, based on the fact that it had three single node communities and the number of distinct communities is less than the number of classes in the human labeled data set, we suspected possible problems that would degrade the quality of the community detection for the use of training text classification models."

We attempt to discover what number of training epochs and which dropout probability yield the best performance for BERT-PT. Since one and two training epochs result in very low scores, results of 3 to 10 training epochs have been depicted for all experiments. For AE, we experiment with 10 different dropout values in the fully connected (linear) layer. The results can be seen in Figure FIGREF6 for laptop and restaurant datasets. To be consistent with the previous work and because of the results having high variance, each point in the figure (F1 score) is the average of 9 runs. In the end, for each number of training epochs, a dropout value, which outperforms the other values, is found. In our experiments, we noticed that the validation loss increases after 2 epochs as has been mentioned in the original paper. However, the test results do not follow the same pattern. Looking at the figures, it can be seen that as the number of training epochs increases, better results are produced in the restaurant domain while in the laptop domain the scores go down. This can be attributed to the selection of validation sets as for both domains the last 150 examples of the SemEval training set were selected. Therefore, it can be said that the examples in the validation and test sets for laptop have more similar patterns than those of restaurant dataset. To be consistent with BERT-PT, we performed the same selection."

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a branch of sentiment analysis which deals with extracting the opinion targets (aspects) as well as the sentiment expressed towards them. For instance, in the sentence The spaghetti was out of this world., a positive sentiment is mentioned towards the target which is spaghetti. Performing these tasks requires a deep understanding of the language. Traditional machine learning methods such as SVM BIBREF2, Naive Bayes BIBREF3, Decision Trees BIBREF4, Maximum Entropy BIBREF5 have long been practiced to acquire such knowledge. However, in recent years due to the abundance of available data and computational power, deep learning methods such as CNNs BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, RNNs BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11, and the Transformer BIBREF12 have outperformed the traditional machine learning techniques in various tasks of sentiment analysis. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF13 is a deep and powerful language model which uses the encoder of the Transformer in a self-supervised manner to learn the language model. It has been shown to result in state-of-the-art performances on the GLUE benchmark BIBREF14 including text classification. BIBREF1 show that adding domain-specific information to this model can enhance its performance in ABSA. Using their post-trained BERT (BERT-PT), we add adversarial examples to further improve BERT's performance on Aspect Extraction (AE) and Aspect Sentiment Classification (ASC) which are two major tasks in ABSA.

We would also like to explore other possible tensor operations and integrate them with our RNN architecture. By applying these ideas together, we expect to gain further performance improvement. Last, for further investigation we will apply our proposed models to other temporal and sequential tasks, such as speech recognition and video recognition."

The data set is built from the Ubuntu IRC chat room where a number of users discuss Ubuntu-related technical issues. The log is organized as one file per day corresponding to a document INLINEFORM0 . Each document consists of (Time, SenderID, Utterance) lines. If users explicitly mention addressees at the beginning of the utterance, the addresseeID is extracted. Then a sample, namely a unit of input (the dialog context and the current sender) and output (the addressee and response prediction) for the task, is created to predict the ground-truth addressee and response of this line. Note that samples are created only when the addressee is explicitly mentioned for clear, unambiguous ground-truth labels. False response candidates are randomly chosen from all other utterances within the same document. Therefore, distractors are likely from the same sub-conversation or even from the same sender but at different time steps. This makes it harder than BIBREF22 lowe2015ubuntu where distractors are randomly chosen from all documents.

The improvement is more obvious with more candidate responses (2% in RES-CAND INLINEFORM2 and 4% in RES-CAND INLINEFORM3 ).

Two factors are known to cause Edit-1-Rerank worse than Retrieval-Rerank. 1) Rerank algorithm is biased to long responses, that poses a challenge for the editing model. 2) Despite of better prototype responses, a context of top-1 response is always greatly different from current context, leading to a large insertion word set and a large deletion set, that also obstructs the revision process. In terms of diversity, our methods drop on distinct-1 and distinct-2 in a comparison with retrieval-based methods, because the editing model often deletes special words pursuing for better relevance.

Edit-Rerank is better than generative baselines on relevance but Edit-default is not, indicating a good prototype selector is quite important to our editing model. In terms of originality, about 86 INLINEFORM0 revised response do not appear in the training set, that surpasses S2SA, S2SA-MMI and CVAE. This is mainly because baseline methods are more likely to generate safe responses that are frequently appeared in the training data, while our model tends to modify an existing response that avoids duplication issue. In terms of fluency, S2SA achieves the best results, and retrieval based approaches come to the second place. Safe response enjoys high score on fluency, that is why S2SA and S2SA-MMI perform well on this metric. Although editing based methods are not the best on the fluency metric, they also achieve a high absolute number.

Given a conversational context INLINEFORM0 , we first retrieve a similar context INLINEFORM1 and its associated response INLINEFORM2 from a pre-defined index, which are called prototype context and prototype response respectively. Then, we calculate an edit vector by concatenating the weighted average results of insertion word embeddings (words in prototype context but not in current context) and deletion word embeddings (words in current context but not in prototype context). After that, we revise the prototype response conditioning on the edit vector. We further illustrate how our idea works with an example in Table TABREF1 . It is obvious that the major difference between INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 is what the speaker eats, so the phrase \u201craw green vegetables\" in INLINEFORM5 should be replaced by \u201cdesserts\" in order to adapt to the current context INLINEFORM6 .

The new paradigm does not only inherits the fluency and informativeness advantages from retrieval results, but also enjoys the flexibility of generation results. Hence, our edit-based model is better than previous retrieval-based and generation-based models. The edit-based model can solve the \u201csafe response\" problem of generative models by leveraging existing responses, and is more flexible than retrieval-based models, because it does not highly depend on the index and is able to edit a response to fit current context."

The other method is to add loss control in the model as mentioned in SECREF2. The loss function helps the model to focus on harder cases in different classes and therefore reduce the impact of the imbalanced data. The experimental results are in SECREF11."

            "The rule-based TN model can handle the TN task alone and is the baseline in our experiments. It has the same idea as in BIBREF8 but has a more complicated system of rules with priorities. The model contains 45 different groups and about 300 patterns as sub-groups, each of which uses a keyword with regular expressions to match the preceding and following texts. Each pattern also has a priority value. During normalization, each sentence is fed as input and the NSW will be matched by the regular expressions. The model tries to match patterns with longer context and slowly decrease the context length until a match is found. If there are multiple pattern matches with the same length, the one with a higher priority will be chosen for the NSW. The model has been developed on abundant test data and bad cases. The advantage of the rule-based system is the flexibility, since one can simply add more special cases when they appear, such as new units. However, improving the performance of this system on more general cases becomes a bottleneck. For example, in a report of a football game, it cannot transform \u201c1-3\u201d to score if there are no keywords like \u201cscore\u201d or \u201cgame\u201d close to it."

In Text-To-Speech (TTS), text normalization is an essential procedure to normalize unreadable numbers, symbols or characters, such as transforming \u201c$20\u201d to \u201ctwenty dollars\u201d and \u201c@\u201d to \u201cat\u201d, into words that can be used in speech synthesis. The surrounding context is the determinant for ambiguous cases in TN. For example, the context will decide whether to read \u201c2019\u201d as year or a number, and whether to read \u201c10:30\u201d as time or the score of a game. In Mandarin, some cases depend on language habit instead of rules- \u201c2\u201d can either be read as \u201cr\u201d or \u201cling\u201d and \u201c1\u201d as \u201cy\u201d or \u201cyo\u201d."

We note that NMT differs from previous work which has mainly explored non-recurrent models in the multi-class prediction setting. For NMT, while the model is trained on multi-class prediction at the word-level, it is tasked with predicting complete sequence outputs conditioned on previous decisions. With this difference in mind, we experiment with standard knowledge distillation for NMT and also propose two new versions of the approach that attempt to approximately match the sequence-level (as opposed to word-level) distribution of the teacher network. This sequence-level approximation leads to a simple training procedure wherein the student network is trained on a newly generated dataset that is the result of running beam search with the teacher network."

We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates the stance distributions of tweets discussing $true$ rumors, $false$ rumors, and $unverified$ rumors, respectively. As we can see, $supporting$ stance dominates the inception phase of spreading. However, as time goes by, the proportion of $denying$ tweets towards $false$ rumors increases quite significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of $querying$ tweets towards $unverified$ rumors also shows an upward trend. Based on this observation, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution with a recurrent neural network (RNN), capturing the crucial signals containing in stance features for effective veracity prediction."

Similar to the machine translation tasks, the learning rate warm-up stage can be removed for the Pre-LN model. The Pre-LN model can be trained faster. For example, the Post-LN model achieves 1.69 validation loss at 500k updates while the Pre-LN model achieves similar validation loss at 700k updates, which suggests there is a 40% speed-up rate. Note that $T_{warmup}$ (10k) is far less than the acceleration (200k) which suggests the Pre-LN Transformer is easier to optimize using larger learning rates. We also evaluate different model checkpoints on the downstream task MRPC and RTE (more details can be found in the supplementary material). The experiments results are plotted in Figure FIGREF48 and FIGREF49. We can see that the Pre-LN model also converges faster on the downstream tasks."

As latency in simultaneous machine translation is essential and is worth to be intensively investigated, we compare the latency of our models with that of the previous work using our Equilibrium Efficiency metric. As shown in Figure FIGREF58 , we plot the translation quality and INLINEFORM0 on the NIST06 dev set. Clearly, compared to the baseline system, our model significantly reduce the time delay while remains a competitive translation quality. When treating segments as IUs, the latency can be further reduced by approximate 20% (23.13 INLINEFORM1 18.65), with a slight decrease in BLEU score (47.61 INLINEFORM2 47.27). One interesting finding is that the granularity of information units largely affects both the translation quality and latency. It is clear the decoding based on sub-sentence and based on segment present different performance in two metrics. For the former model, the increase of discarded tokens results in an obvious decrease in translation quality, but no definite improvement in latency. The latter model can benefit from the increasing of discarding tokens both in translation quality and latency."

Moreover, as we allow the model to discard a few previously generated tokens, the performance can be further improved to 39.82 ( INLINEFORM2 0.16), at a small cost of longer latency (see Figure FIGREF58 ). It is consistent with our intuition that our novel partial decoding strategy can bring stable improvement on each testing dataset. It achieves an average improvement of 0.44 BLEU score (39.22 INLINEFORM3 39.66) compared to the context-aware system in which we do not fine-tune the trained model when using partial decoding strategy. An interesting finding is that our translation model performs better than the baseline system on the NIST08 testing set. We analyze the translation results and find that the sentences in NIST08 are extremely long, which affect the standard Transformer to learn better representation BIBREF23 . Using context-aware decoding strategy to generate consistent and coherent translation, our model performs better by focusing on generating translation for relatively shorter sub-sentences."

As shown in the table, on RACE-M, DFN leads to a 7.8% and 7.3% performance boost over GA and Stanford AR, respectively. On RACE-H, the outperformance is 1.5% and 2.7%. The ensemble models also gained a performance boost of 4-5% comparing to previous methods. We suspect that the lower gain on RACE-H might result from the higher level of difficulty in those questions in RACE-H, as well as ambiguity in the dataset. Human performance drops from 85.1 on RACE-M to 69.4 on RACE-H, which indicates RACE-H is very challenging even for human."

The KDG system generates its training data using an algorithm proposed by BIBREF3 . This algorithm applies a pruning step (discussed in Section SECREF3 ) to eliminate spurious training data entries. We find that without this pruning of the training data, accuracy of the KDG model drops to 36.3%. We consider this an important finding as the pruning step not only accounts for a large fraction of the improvement in the state-of-the-art KDG model but may also be relevant to training other models. In what follows, we briefly discuss the pruning algorithm, how we identified its importance for the KDG model, and its relevance to further work."

This logical form leads to the correct answer only because countries in the table happen to be sorted in descending order.",

Since 20 Newsgroups is a relatively small dataset, we used all words and bigrams from its documents. This amounts to a vocabulary with slightly over one million elements. For the RCV1 dataset we used words and bigrams with at least 10 occurrences in the text, which gives a vocabulary with approximately 800 thousands elements.

            "The 20 Newsgroups dataset comes with reference train/test sets. In case of RCV1 we used half of the documents for training and the other half for evaluation. In case of English Wikipedia we held out for testing randomly selected 10% of the documents. We perform document retrieval by selecting queries from the test set and ordering other test documents according to the similarity of the inferred codes. We use Hamming distance for binary codes and cosine similarity for real-valued representations. Results are averaged over queries. We assess the performance of our models with precision-recall curves and two popular information retrieval metrics, namely mean average precision (MAP) and the normalized discounted cumulative gain at the 10th result (NDCG@10) BIBREF16 . The results depend, of course, on the chosen document relevancy measure. Relevancy measure for the 20 Newsgroups dataset is straightforward: a retrieved document is relevant to the query if they both belong to the same newsgroup. In RCV1 each document belongs to a hierarchy of topics, making the definition of relevancy less obvious. In this case we adopted the relevancy measure used by BIBREF3 . That is, the relevancy is calculated as the fraction of overlapping labels in a retrieved document and the query document. Overall, our selection of test datasets and relevancy measures for 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 follows BIBREF3 , enabling comparison with semantic hashing codes. To assess the relevancy of articles in English Wikipedia we can employ categories assigned to them. However, unlike in RCV1, Wikipedia categories can have multiple parent categories and cyclic dependencies. Therefore, for this dataset we adopted a simplified relevancy measure: two articles are relevant if they share at least one category. We also removed from the test set categories with less than 20 documents as well as documents that were left with no categories. Overall, the relevancy is measured over more than INLINEFORM0 categories, making English Wikipedia harder than the other two benchmarks."

In my opinion, another possible explanation is that a word in word sequence may more statistically depend on the following context than previous one. After all, a number of words are determined by its following words instead of previous ones in some natural languages. Take the articles in English as examples, indefinite article \"an\" is used when the first syllable of next word is a vowel while \"a\" is preposed before words starting with consonant. What's more, if a noun is qualified by an attributive clause, definite article \"the\" should be used before the noun. These examples illustrate that words in a word sequence depends on their following words sometimes. To verify this hypothesis further, an experiment is performed here in which the word order of every input sentence is reversed, and the probability of word sequence INLINEFORM0 is evaluated as following: INLINEFORM1"

Maybe more data is needed to train RNNLM and LSTM-RNNLM because longer dependencies are taken into account by RNNLM and LSTM-RNNLM when predicting next word. LSTM-RNNLM with bias terms or direct connections was also evaluated here. When the direct connections between input layer and output layer of LSTM-RNN are enabled, a slightly higher perplexity but shorter training time were obtained. An explanation given for this phenomenon by BIBREF10 is that direct connections provide a bit more capacity and faster learning of the \"linear\" part of mapping from inputs to outputs but impose a negative effect on generalization. For bias terms, no significant improvement on performance was gained by adding bias terms which was also observed on RNNLM by BIBREF16 .

I have not come up with a complete solution yet but some ideas which will be explored further next. First, the architecture showed in Figure FIGREF19 can be used as a general improvement scheme for ANN, and I will try to figure out the structure of changeless neural network for encoder. What's more, word sequences are commonly taken as signals for LM, and it is easy to take linguistical properties of words or sentences as the features of signals. However, it maybe not a proper way to deal with natural languages. Natural languages are not natural but man-made, and linguistical knowledge are also created by human long after natural language appeared. Liguistical knowledge only covers the \"right\" word sequences in a natural language, but it is common to deal with \"wrong\" ones in real world. In nature, every natural language is a mechanism of linking voices or signs with objects, both concrete and abstract. Therefore, the proper way to deal with natural languages is to find the relations between special voices or signs and objects, and the features of voices or signs can be defined easier than a natural language itself. Every voice or sign can be encoded as a unique code, vector or matrix, according to its features, and the similarities among voices or signs are indeed can be recognized from their codes. It is really difficult to model the relation between voices or signs and objects at once, and this work should be split into several steps. The first step is to covert voice or sign into characters, i.e., speech recognition or image recognition, but it is achieved using the architecture described in Figure FIGREF19 ."

The unconstrained meeting scenario involves many challenges, including face occlusions, extreme head pose, lighting conditions, compression artifacts, low resolution due to device-to-person distances, motion blur. Therefore, any individual frame may not contain necessary information. For example, a face may not be detectable in some frames. Even if it is detectable, it may not be recognizable.",
            "To handle this variability, we integrate information across time using face tracking as implied by our formulation of $P(h | r, V)$, which requires face identification to be performed only at a tracklet level. Our face tracking uses face detection and low-level tracking to maintain a set of tracklets, where each tracklet is defined as a sequence of faces in time that belong to the same person. We use a method similar to that in BIBREF50 with several adaptions to our specific setting, such as exploiting the stationarity of the camera for detecting motion, performing the low-level tracking by color based mean-shift instead of gray-level based normalized correlation, tuning the algorithm to minimize the risk of tracklet mergers (which in our context are destructive), etc. Also, the faces in each tracklet are augmented with attributes such as face position, dimensions, head pose, and face feature vectors. The tracklet set defines $\\mathcal {R}$ of equation (DISPLAY_FORM7).",

Guest IDs (e.g., 'Speaker1') are produced online, each representing a unique person in the meeting who is not on the invitee list. We utilize a discriminative face embedding which converts face images into fixed-dimensional feature vectors, or 128-dimensional vectors obtained as output layer activations of a convolutional neural network. For the face embedding and detection components, we use the algorithms from Microsoft Cognitive Services Face API BIBREF51, BIBREF52. Face identification of a tracklet is performed by comparing the set of face features extracted from its face instances, to the set of features from a gallery of each person's faces. For invited people, the galleries are taken from their enrollment videos, while for guests, the gallery pictures are accumulated online from the meeting video. We next describe our set-to-set similarity measure designed to perform this comparison.",

We follow the matched background similarity (MBGS) approach of BIBREF53 and make crucial adaptations to it that increase accuracy significantly for our problem. As with MBGS, we train a discriminative classifier for each identity $h$ in $\\mathcal {H}$. The gallery of $h$ is used as positive examples, while a separate fixed background set $B$ is used as negative examples. This approach has two important benefits. First, it allows us to train a classifier adapted to a specific person. Second, the use of a background set $B$ lets us account for misleading sources of variation e.g. if a blurry or poorly lit face from $B$ is similar to one of the positive examples, the classifier's decision boundary can be chosen accordingly. During meeting initialization, an support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish between the positive and negative sets for each invitee. At test time, we are given a tracklet $T=\\big \\lbrace \\mathbf {t}_1,...,\\mathbf {t}_N\\big \\rbrace $ represented as a set of face feature vectors $\\mathbf {t}_i\\in {\\mathbb {R}^d}$, and we classify each member $\\mathbf {t}_i$ with the classifier of each identity $h$ and obtain a set of classification confidences $\\big \\lbrace s\\big (T\\big )_{i,h}\\big \\rbrace $.

When $s=\\max _{h} s_h$ is smaller than a threshold, a new guest identity is added to $\\mathcal {H}$, where the classifier for this person is trained by using $T$ as positive examples. $\\lbrace s_h\\rbrace _{h \\in \\mathcal {H}}$ is converted to a set of posterior probabilities $\\lbrace P(h | r, V)\\rbrace _{h \\in \\mathcal {H}}$ with a trained regression model.",

Overton learns the accuracy of these sources using ideas from the Snorkel project BIBREF1. In particular, it estimates the accuracy of these sources and then uses these accuracies to compute a probability that each training point is correct BIBREF9. Overton incorporates this information into the loss function for a task; this also allows Overton to automatically handle common issues like rebalancing classes."

            "In retrospect, the following three choices of Overton were the most important in meeting the above challenges.",
            "(1) Code-free Deep Learning In Overton-based systems, engineers focus exclusively on fine-grained monitoring of their application quality and improving supervision\u2013not tweaking deep learning models. An Overton engineer does not write any deep learning code in frameworks like TensorFlow. To support application quality improvement, we use a technique, called model slicing BIBREF3. The main idea is to allow the developer to identify fine-grained subsets of the input that are important to the product, e.g., queries about nutrition or queries that require sophisticated disambiguation. The system uses developer-defined slices as a guide to increase representation capacity. Using this recently developed technique led to state-of-the-art results on natural language benchmarks including GLUE and SuperGLUE BIBREF4.",
            "(2) Multitask Learning Overton was built to natively support multitask learning BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7 so that all model tasks are concurrently predicted. A key benefit is that Overton can accept supervision at whatever granularity (for whatever task) is available. Overton models often perform ancillary tasks like part-of-speech tagging or typing. Intuitively, if a representation has captured the semantics of a query, then it should reliably perform these ancillary tasks. Typically, ancillary tasks are also chosen either to be inexpensive to supervise. Ancillary task also allow developers to gain confidence in the model's predictions and have proved to be helpful for aids for debugging errors.",
            "(3) Weak Supervision Applications have access to supervision of varying quality and combining this contradictory and incomplete supervision is a major challenge.

In more detail, the schema has two elements: (1) data payloads similar to a relational schema, which describe the input data, and (2) model tasks, which describe the tasks that need to be accomplished. The schema defines the input, output, and coarse-grained data flow of a deep learning model. Informally, the schema defines what the model computes but not how the model computes it: Overton does not prescribe architectural details of the underlying model (e.g., Overton is free to embed sentences using an LSTM or a Transformer) or hyperparameters, like hidden state size.

It should be noted that Ludwig made a different choice: no search is required, and so zero-code deep learning does not depend on search. The area of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) BIBREF28 is booming: the goal of this area is to perform search (typically reinforcement learning but also increasingly random search BIBREF29). This has led to exciting architectures like EfficientNet BIBREF30. This is a tremendously exciting area with regular workshops at all major machine learning conferences. Overton is inspired by this area. On a technical level, the search used in Overton is a coarser-grained search than what is typically done in NAS. In particular, Overton searches over relatively limited large blocks, e.g., should we use an LSTM or CNN, not at a fine-grained level of connections. In preliminary experiments, NAS methods seemed to have diminishing returns and be quite expensive. More sophisticated search could only improve Overton, and we are excited to continue to apply advances in this area to Overton. Speed of developer iteration and the ability to ship production models seems was a higher priority than exploring fine details of architecture in Overton."

Each fold is a subset of the data randomly picked for testing. Models are trained on the INLINEFORM2 folds and their performance is estimated on the left-out fold. INLINEFORM3 -fold cross-validation has several practical advantages, such as an efficient use of all the data. However, it is also based on an assumption that the data is independent and identically distributed BIBREF9 which is often not true. For example, in time-ordered data, such as Twitter posts, the data are to some extent dependent due to the underlying temporal order of tweets. Therefore, using INLINEFORM4 -fold cross-validation means that one uses future information to predict past events, which might hinder the generalization ability of models.",

The most common are sequential approaches typically used in time series forecasting tasks. Some variants of INLINEFORM0 -fold cross-validation which relax the independence assumption were also proposed. For time-ordered data, an estimation procedure is sequential when testing is always performed on the data subsequent to the training set. Typically, the data is split into two parts, where the first is used to train the model and the second is held out for testing. These approaches are also known in the literature as the out-of-sample methods BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 .",

A time series is an array of observations at regular or equidistant time points, and the observations are in general dependent on previous observations BIBREF0 . On the other hand, Twitter data is time-ordered, but the observations are short texts posted by Twitter users at any time and frequency. It can be assumed that original Twitter posts are not directly dependent on previous posts. However, there is a potential indirect dependence, demonstrated in important trends and events, through influential users and communities, or individual user's habits. These long-term topic drifts are typically not taken into account by the sentiment analysis models."

            "Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.",
            "In sequential validation, a sample consists of the training set immediately followed by the test set. We vary the ratio of the training and test set sizes, and the number and distribution of samples taken from the in-set. The number of samples is 10 or 20, and they are distributed equidistantly or semi-equidistantly. In all variants, samples cover the whole in-set, but they are overlapping. See Figure FIGREF20 for illustration. We use the following abbreviations for sequential validations:",

A realistic scenario is emulated by partitioning the data into 138 datasets by language and time window. Each dataset is split into an in-sample (a training plus test set), where estimation procedures are applied to approximate the performance of a model, and an out-of-sample used to compute the gold standard. Our goal is to understand the ability of each estimation procedure to approximate the true error incurred by a given model on the out-of-sample data."

This is, to the best of our knowledge, by far the largest set of sentiment labeled tweets publicly available. We engaged native speakers to label the tweets based on the sentiment expressed in them. The sentiment label has three possible values: negative, neutral or positive. It turned out that the human annotators perceived the values as ordered. The quality of annotations varies though, and is estimated from the self- and inter-annotator agreements. All the details about the datasets, the annotator agreements, and the ordering of sentiment values are in our previous study BIBREF22 . The sentiment distribution and quality of individual language datasets is in Table TABREF2 . The tweets in the datasets are ordered by tweet ids, which corresponds to ordering by the time of posting."

The task encompasses identification and categorization of opinions (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive) written in quasi-natural language used in Twitter posts. We focus on estimation procedures of the predictive performance of machine learning models used to address this task. Performance estimation procedures are key to understand the generalization ability of the models since they present approximations of how these models will behave on unseen data. In the particular case of sentiment analysis of Twitter data, high volumes of content are continuously being generated and there is no immediate feedback about the true class of instances. In this context, it is fundamental to adopt appropriate estimation procedures in order to get reliable estimates about the performance of the models."
