        "To decouple syntactic and semantic information in utterances and provide detailed supervision, we design a hierarchical intent annotation scheme for non-collaborative tasks. We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.",
        "In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).",
        "To better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains. BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.",
        "To tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as \u201copen question\" are general to all tasks.",
        "We make two major changes: (1) To address the problem that TransferTransfo is originally designed for an open domain without explicit intents and regulations, we add two intent classifiers and two semantic slot classifiers to classify the intents and semantic slots for both human utterances and system responses as an effort to incorporate the proposed hierarchical intent and semantic slot annotation for non-collaborative tasks. (2) In dialog systems, multiple generated responses can be coherent under the current context. Generating diverse responses has proven to be an enduring challenge. To increase response diversity, we sample multiple generated responses and choose an appropriate one according to a set of pre-defined rules."

        "Authoring Rules from CNL. There are two research problems with rules. The first problem is the standardization of rules parses that express the same information but via different syntactic forms or using different expressions. Suppose the knowledge base contains sentences like: (1) if a person buys a car then the person owns the car, (2) every person who is a purchaser of a car is an owner of the car, (3) if a car is bought by a person then the person possesses the car. All the above sentences represent rules and express exactly the same meaning. However, KALM's current syntactic parser will represent them in different DRSs and therefore not being able to map them into the same logical form. The second problem involves the recognition and representation of different types of rules in logic. For instance, defeasible rules are very common in text. However, this type of rules cannot be handled by first order logic. We believe defeasible logic BIBREF19 is a good fit.",

        "Controlled natural languages (CNLs) BIBREF0 were developed as a technology that achieves this goal. CNLs are designed based on natural languages (NLs) but with restricted syntax and interpretation rules that determine the unique meaning of the sentence. Representative CNLs include Attempto Controlled English BIBREF1 and PENG BIBREF2 . Each CNL is developed with a language parser which translates the English sentences into an intermediate structure, discourse representation structure (DRS) BIBREF3 . Based on the DRS structure, the language parsers further translate the DRS into the corresponding logical representations, e.g., Answer Set Programming (ASP) BIBREF4 programs. One main issue with the aforementioned CNLs is that the systems do not provide enough background knowledge to preserve semantic equivalences of sentences that represent the same meaning but are expressed via different linguistic structures. For instance, the sentences Mary buys a car and Mary makes a purchase of a car are translated into different logical representations by the current CNL parsers. As a result, if the user ask a question who is a buyer of a car, these systems will fail to find the answer."

We thus selected 5 word embeddings for Italian to initialize the network, differentiating one with respect to each other either for the representation model used (word2vec vs. GloVe; CBOW vs. skip-gram), dimensionality (300 vs. 100), or corpora used for their generation (Italian Wikipedia vs. crawled web document vs. large textual corpora or archives):",

By analyzing the True Positives, we observe that the Fastext-It model has better performances than FBK-HLT with nouns (77.78% vs. 65.64%, respectively) and prepositional phrases (28.00% vs. 16.00%, respectively). Performances are very close for verbs (88.04% vs. 88.49%, respectively) and adjectives (80.50% vs. 79.66%, respectively).

As highlighted by a recent UNESCO report BIBREF5, appropriate responses to abusive queries are vital to prevent harmful gender biases: the often submissive and flirty responses by the female-gendered systems reinforce ideas of women as subservient. In this paper, we investigate the appropriateness of possible strategies by gathering responses from current state-of-the-art systems and ask crowd-workers to rate them."

To this end, the WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity BIBREF0 represents the first task where systems have to automatically determine the intensity of emotions in tweets.

For instance, the hateful tweets presented in Figure FIGREF5 show toxicity directed towards different targets, with or without using slurs, and generating several types of reactions. We believe that, in order to balance between truth and subjectivity, there are at least five important aspects in hate speech analysis. Hence, our annotations indicate (a) whether the text is direct or indirect; (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hateful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal; (c) the attribute based on which it discriminates against an individual or a group of people; (d) the name of this group; and (e) how the annotators feel about its content within a range of negative to neutral sentiments.

Since the target group classification task involves 16 labels, the amount of data annotated for each label is lower than in other tasks.

Recently, NMT produced first encouraging results in the autoformalization task BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3 where given an informal mathematical text in the goal is to translate it to its formal (computer understandable) counterpart. In particular, the NMT performance on a large synthetic -to-Mizar dataset produced by a relatively sophisticated toolchain developed for several decades BIBREF4 is surprisingly good BIBREF3, indicating that neural networks can learn quite complicated algorithms for symbolic data.

TreeNNs are built recursively from modules, where the modules corresponds to parts of symbolic expression (symbols) and the shape of the network reflects the parse tree of the processed expression. This way model is explicitly informed on the exact structure of the expression, which in case of formal logic is always unambiguous and easy to extract. Perhaps this way the model could learn more efficiently from examples (and achieve higher results even on the small AIM data sets).

To control for the ratio of samples from different language pairs, we sample a fixed number of sentences from the training data, with the probability of a sentence belonging to language pair $l$ being proportional to $p_l^{\\frac{1}{T}}$, where $T$ is the sampling temperature. As a result, $T=1$ would correspond to a true data distribution, and, $T=100$ yields an (almost) equal number of samples for each language pair (close to a uniform distribution with over-sampling for low-resource language-pairs).

Apart from the 103 language setting, we consider 2 additional settings: 1) where we train mNMT on 4 languages to and from English, and 2) where we use 25 languages. The results are presented in Table TABREF37. We see that as we scale up the languages the zero-shot performance goes down on both POS tagging and XNLI tasks. These losses align with the relative BLEU scores of these models suggesting that the regressions are due to interference arising from the large number of languages attenuating the capacity of the NMT model. Scaling up the mNMT model to include more languages without diminishing cross-lingual effectiveness is a direction for future work.",
        "Given the wide distribution of data across language pairs, we used a temperature based data balancing strategy. For a given language pair, $l$, let $D_l$ be the size of the available parallel corpus. Then if we adopt a naive strategy and sample from the union of the datasets, the probability of the sample being from language pair $l$ will be $p_l=\\frac{D_l}{\\Sigma _lD_l}$. However, this strategy would starve low resource language pairs. To control for the ratio of samples from different language pairs, we sample a fixed number of sentences from the training data, with the probability of a sentence belonging to language pair $l$ being proportional to $p_l^{\\frac{1}{T}}$, where $T$ is the sampling temperature. As a result, $T=1$ would correspond to a true data distribution, and, $T=100$ yields an (almost) equal number of samples for each language pair (close to a uniform distribution with over-sampling for low-resource language-pairs). We set $T=5$ for a balanced sampling strategy. To control the contribution of each language pair when constructing the vocabulary, we use the same temperature based sampling strategy with $T=5$. Our SPM vocabulary has a character coverage of $0.999995$.",

        "Asking humans to evaluate the quality of a dialogue model is challenging, especially when multiple models have to be compared. The likert score (a.k.a. 1 to 5 scoring) has been widely used to evaluate the interactive experience with conversational models BIBREF70, BIBREF65, BIBREF0, BIBREF1. In such evaluation, a human interacts with the systems for several turns, and then they assign a score from 1 to 5 based on three questions BIBREF0 about fluency, engagingness, and consistency. This evaluation is both expensive to conduct and requires many samples to achieve statistically significant results BIBREF6. To cope with these issues, BIBREF6 proposed ACUTE-EVAL, an A/B test evaluation for dialogue systems. The authors proposed two modes: human-model chats and self-chat BIBREF71, BIBREF72. In this work, we opt for the latter since it is cheaper to conduct and achieves similar results BIBREF6 to the former. Another advantage of using this method is the ability to evaluate multi-turn conversations instead of single-turn responses.",

In this work, we address a system element by constructing a common-knowledge concept recognition system for improving the performance of SEVA, using the static knowledge collected from the Systems Engineering Handbook BIBREF1 that is widely used in projects across the organization as domain-specific commonsense knowledge. At NASA, although there exists knowledge engines and ontologies for the SE domain such as MBSE BIBREF2, IMCE BIBREF3, and OpenCaesar BIBREF4, generic commonsense acquisition is rarely discussed; we aim to address this challenge. SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE .",

In NASA's context, systems engineering combines several engineering disciplines requiring extreme coordination and is prone to human errors. This, in combination with the lack of efficient knowledge transfer of generic lessons-learned makes most technology-based missions risk-averse.

        "The Systems Engineer's Virtual Assistant (SEVA) BIBREF0 was introduced with the goal to assist systems engineers (SE) in their problem-solving abilities by keeping track of large amounts of information of a NASA-specific project and using the information to answer queries from the user. In this work, we address a system element by constructing a common-knowledge concept recognition system for improving the performance of SEVA, using the static knowledge collected from the Systems Engineering Handbook BIBREF1 that is widely used in projects across the organization as domain-specific commonsense knowledge. At NASA, although there exists knowledge engines and ontologies for the SE domain such as MBSE BIBREF2, IMCE BIBREF3, and OpenCaesar BIBREF4, generic commonsense acquisition is rarely discussed; we aim to address this challenge. SE commonsense comes from years of experience and learning which involves background knowledge that goes beyond any handbook. Although constructing an assistant like SEVA system is the overarching objective, a key problem to first address is to extract elementary common-knowledge concepts using the SE handbook and domain experts. We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain. We propose a preliminary research study that can pave a path towards a comprehensive commonsense knowledge acquisition for an effective Artificial Intelligence (AI) application for the SE domain. Overall structure of this work is summarized in Figure 1. Implementation with demo and dataset is available at: https://github.com/jitinkrishnan/NASA-SE .",
        "Creating commonsense AI still remains an important and challenging task in AI research today. Some of the inspiring works are the CYC project BIBREF5 that tries to serve as a foundational knowledge to all systems with millions of everyday life commonsense assertions, Mosaic Commonsense Knowledge Graphs and Reasoning BIBREF6 that addresses aspects like social situations, mental states, and causal relationships, and Aristo System BIBREF7 that focuses on basic science knowledge. In NASA's context, systems engineering combines several engineering disciplines requiring extreme coordination and is prone to human errors. This, in combination with the lack of efficient knowledge transfer of generic lessons-learned makes most technology-based missions risk-averse. Thus, a comprehensive commonsense engine can significantly enhance the productivity of any mission by letting the experts focus on what they do best."

        "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table.

        "Another aspect that is worth commenting in the first phase is that it is most beneficial that one does not train the top model until it reaches the highest accuracy on the training or validation data sets, but rather only up to a point where the prediction accuracy of the training and validation data sets do not differ much. This is intuitively reasonable for the following reasons. Unlike word embeddings, the pre-trained language models possess a large number of parameters compared to the task-specific models we build on top them. Therefore, if one were to train the top models until they reach the highest prediction accuracy in the training or validation data sets, it would likely cause the models to over-fit. Therefore, in our experiment, we found that this leads to the highest performance increase in the fine-tuning stage.",
        "In principles, there are three ways to train the networks with stacked neural networks on top of pre-trained language models, as shown in Table TABREF1 . In Peters et al . BIBREF0 , the authors compare the possibility of option stack-only and finetune-only, and conclude that option finetune-only is better than option stack-only. More specifically, Peter et al. BIBREF0 argue that it is better to add a task-specific head on top of BERT than to freeze the weights of BERT and add more complex network structures. However, Peters et al. BIBREF0 did not compare option stack-and-finetune and finetune-only. On the other hand, before pre-trained deep language models became popular, researchers often use a strategy analog to option stack-and-finetune. That is, modelers first train the model until convergence, and then fine-tune the word embeddings with a few epochs. If pre-trained language models can be understood as at least partially resemblance of word embeddings, then it will be imprudent not to consider the possibility of option stack-and-finetune."

        "As is shown in Table 2, even without modifying the networks to specifically adapt to the pre-trained model, our training strategy still brought improvement towards overall accuracy of 0.99% for the accuracy and 0.068 on the F1 score, proving the success of our proposed methods.",
        "We perform three different experiments to test our hypotheses. First, we perform a named entity recognition tasks, by adding a bi-LSTM on top of the BERT model. In this experiment, we hope to test whether, without any modification to the commonly used network structure, our proposed training strategy will improve the overall accuracy. Second, we perform a text classification experiments, in this experiments, we trained three models, and perform a model ensemble. We hope to show that even the added network has not contributed to significantly in improving the accuracy, it does provide opportunities for model ensembles. Finally, we perform the textual similarity tests, in which we show that if one can tailor make a network that specifically fit the characteristics of the pre-trained languages, more significant improvement can be expected.",
        "During the experimentation, we also discover some tricks to obtain higher quality networks. The first is that due to the enormous number of parameters presented in the pre-trained language models, to achieve generalizable results on the test data sets, it is vital to combat over-fitting. In classical embedding + training networks, the general training method is to fix the word-embeddings, then train the top model until it converges, and finally fine-tuning the word-embeddings for a few epochs. This training strategy does not work when we replace pre-trained language models with word-embeddings. In our experiment, we first fix the pre-trained language models, and then we train the top neural networks only for a few epochs, until it reaches a reasonable accuracy, while closely monitoring the discrepancy between training accuracy and testing accuracy. After that, we fine-tune the pre-trained language model as well as our models on top together. This allows us to achieve better results on the experimentation. However, it is not yet clear to us when to stop the training of top neural networks. This poses an even more essential question for Auto ML researchers in the following sense. In the classical computer vision based Auto ML approaches, since one seldom build networks on already trained models, there is no particular need to auxiliary measure for over-fittings. While if Auto ML is to be performed on NLP tasks successfully, it might be essential that the gap between training accuracy and test accuracy to be incorporated when one evaluates the model."

The evaluation and comparison results in Table TABREF33 show that compared to PCNN+ATT, the AUC improvement (+0.13) between our model and PCNN+ATT on one-sentence bags is higher than the improvement of full NYT dataset, which verifies SeG's effectiveness on one-sentence bags. In addition, PCNN+ATT shows a light decrease compared with PCNN, which can also support the claim that selective attention is vulnerable to one-sentence bags.",

This scenario is not uncommon. For a popular distantly supervised relation extraction benchmark, e.g., NYT dataset BIBREF2, up to $80\\%$ of its training examples (i.e., bags) are one-sentence bags. From our data inspection, we randomly sample 100 one-sentence bags and find $35\\%$ of them is incorrectly labeled. Two examples of one-sentence bag are shown in Table TABREF1.

        "What constitutes hate speech and when does it differ from offensive language? No formal definition exists but there is a consensus that it is speech that targets disadvantaged social groups in a manner that is potentially harmful to them BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . In the United States, hate speech is protected under the free speech provisions of the First Amendment, but it has been extensively debated in the legal sphere and with regards to speech codes on college campuses. In many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, there are laws prohibiting hate speech, which tends to be defined as speech that targets minority groups in a way that could promote violence or social disorder. People convicted of using hate speech can often face large fines and even imprisonment. These laws extend to the internet and social media, leading many sites to create their own provisions against hate speech. Both Facebook and Twitter have responded to criticism for not doing enough to prevent hate speech on their sites by instituting policies to prohibit the use of their platforms for attacks on people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, or threats of violence towards others.",
        "Drawing upon these definitions, we define hate speech as language that is used to expresses hatred towards a targeted group or is intended to be derogatory, to humiliate, or to insult the members of the group. In extreme cases this may also be language that threatens or incites violence, but limiting our definition only to such cases would exclude a large proportion of hate speech. Importantly, our definition does not include all instances of offensive language because people often use terms that are highly offensive to certain groups but in a qualitatively different manner. For example some African Americans often use the term n*gga in everyday language online BIBREF2 , people use terms like h*e and b*tch when quoting rap lyrics, and teenagers use homophobic slurs like f*g as they play video games. Such language is prevalent on social media BIBREF3 , making this boundary condition crucial for any usable hate speech detection system .",
        "If we conflate hate speech and offensive language then we erroneously consider many people to be hate speakers (errors in the lower triangle of Figure 1) and fail differentiate between commonplace offensive language and serious hate speech (errors in the upper triangle of Figure 1). Given the legal and moral implications of hate speech it is important that we are able to accurately distinguish between the two. Lexical methods are effective ways to identify potentially offensive terms but are inaccurate at identifying hate speech; only a small percentage of tweets flagged by the Hatebase lexicon were considered hate speech by human coders. While automated classification methods can achieve relatively high accuracy at differentiating between these different classes, close analysis of the results shows that the presence or absence of particular offensive or hateful terms can both help and hinder accurate classification.",
        "Hate speech is a difficult phenomenon to define and is not monolithic. Our classifications of hate speech tend to reflect our own subjective biases. People identify racist and homophobic slurs as hateful but tend to see sexist language as merely offensive. While our results show that people perform well at identifying some of the more egregious instances of hate speech, particularly anti-black racism and homophobia, it is important that we are cognizant of the social biases that enter into our algorithms and future work should aim to identify and correct these biases.",
        "Turning to true hate speech classified as offensive it appears that tweets with the highest predicted probability of being offensive are genuinely less hateful and were perhaps mislabeled, for example When you realize how curiosity is a b*tch #CuriosityKilledMe may have been erroneously coded as hate speech if people thought that curiosity was a person, and Why no boycott of racist \"redskins\"? #Redskins #ChangeTheName contains a slur but is actually against racism. It is likely that coders skimmed these tweets too quickly, picking out words or phrases that appeared to be hateful without considering the context. Turning to borderline cases, where the probability of being offensive is marginally higher than hate speech, it appears that the majority are hate speech, both directed towards other Twitter users, @MDreyfus @NatFascist88 Sh*t your ass your moms p*ssy u Jew b*stard. Ur times coming. Heil Hitler! and general hateful statements like My advice of the day: If your a tranny...go f*ck your self!. These tweets fit our definition of hate speech but were likely misclassified because they do not contain any of the terms most strongly associated with hate speech. Finally, the hateful tweets incorrectly labeled as neither tend not to contain hate or curse words, for example If some one isn't an Anglo-Saxon Protestant, they have no right to be alive in the US. None at all, they are foreign filth contains a negative term, filth but no slur against a particular group. We also see that rarer types of hate speech, for example this anti-Chinese statement Every slant in #LA should be deported. Those scum have no right to be here. Chinatown should be bulldozed, are incorrectly classified. While the classifier performs well at prevalent forms of hate speech, particularly anti-black racism and homophobia, but is less reliable at detecting types of hate speech that occur infrequently, a problem noted by BIBREF13 ( BIBREF13 )."

Far fewer tweets are classified as more offensive or hateful than their true category; approximately 5% of offensive and 2% of innocuous tweets have been erroneously classified as hate speech. To explore why these tweets have been misclassified we now look more closely at the tweets and their predicted classes.",

After using a grid-search to iterate over the models and parameters we find that the Logistic Regression and Linear SVM tended to perform significantly better than other models. We decided to use a logistic regression with L2 regularization for the final model as it more readily allows us to examine the predicted probabilities of class membership and has performed well in previous papers BIBREF5 , BIBREF8 . We trained the final model using the entire dataset and used it to predict the label for each tweet. We use a one-versus-rest framework where a separate classifier is trained for each class and the class label with the highest predicted probability across all classifiers is assigned to each tweet. All modeling was performing using scikit-learn BIBREF12 .",

In this paper we label tweets into three categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neither. We train a model to differentiate between these categories and then analyze the results in order to better understand how we can distinguish between them. Our results show that fine-grained labels can help in the task of hate speech detection and highlights some of the key challenges to accurate classification. We conclude that future work must better account for context and the heterogeneity in hate speech usage.",
        "Finally, turning to the neither class, we see that tweets with the highest predicted probability of belonging to this class all appear to be innocuous and were included in the sample because they contained terms included in the Hatebase lexicon such as charlie and bird that are generally not used in a hateful manner. Tweets with overall positive sentiment and higher readability scores are more likely to belong to this class. The tweets in this category that have been misclassified as hate or offensive tend to mention race, sexuality, and other social categories that are targeted by hate speakers. Most appear to be misclassifications appear to be caused by on the presence of potentially offensive language, for example He's a damn good actor. As a gay man it's awesome to see an openly queer actor given the lead role for a major film contains the potentially the offensive terms gay and queer but uses them in a positive sense. This problem has been encountered in previous research BIBREF2 and illustrates the importance of taking context into account. We also found a small number of cases where the coders appear to have missed hate speech that was correctly identified by our model, e.g. @mayormcgunn @SenFeinstein White people need those weapons to defend themselves from the subhuman trash your sort unleashes on us. This finding is consistent with previous work that has found amateur coders to often be unreliable at identifying abusive content BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 .",

Tweets with overall positive sentiment and higher readability scores are more likely to belong to this class. The tweets in this category that have been misclassified as hate or offensive tend to mention race, sexuality, and other social categories that are targeted by hate speakers. Most appear to be misclassifications appear to be caused by on the presence of potentially offensive language, for example He's a damn good actor. As a gay man it's awesome to see an openly queer actor given the lead role for a major film contains the potentially the offensive terms gay and queer but uses them in a positive sense. This problem has been encountered in previous research BIBREF2 and illustrates the importance of taking context into account. We also found a small number of cases where the coders appear to have missed hate speech that was correctly identified by our model, e.g. @mayormcgunn @SenFeinstein White people need those weapons to defend themselves from the subhuman trash your sort unleashes on us.

Pedagogically, understanding the relationship between the number of fine-tuned layers and the resulting model quality may guide future works in modeling.",

As more layers are fine-tuned, the model effectiveness often improves drastically\u2014see CoLA and STS-B, the first and fourth vertical pairs of subfigures from the left. This demonstrates that gains decompose nonadditively with respect to the number of frozen initial layers. Fine-tuning subsequent layers shows diminishing returns, with every model rapidly approaching the baseline quality at fine-tuning half of the network; hence, we believe that half is a reasonable cutoff point for characterizing the models.",

Additionally, we restrict our comprehensive all-datasets exploration to the base variant of BERT, since the large model variants and RoBERTa are much more computationally intensive.

They experimented with several word embedding algorithms trained on Indonesian Wikipedia data and reported macro-averaged INLINEFORM0 score of 91 and 73 for the single- and multi-word expression cases respectively. We remark that the choice of macro-averaged INLINEFORM1 score is more suitable than accuracy for POS tagging because of the class imbalance in the dataset. There are too many words with NN as the true POS tag, so accuracy is not the best metric in such case."

Additionally, the critical reason why Chinese characters are so rich in morphological information is that they are composed of basic strokes in a 2-D spatial order. However, different spatial configurations of strokes may lead to different semantics. As shown in the lower half of Figure 1, three Chinese characters \u201c\u5165\" (enter), \u201c\u516b\" (eight) and \u201c\u4eba\" (man) share exactly a common stroke sequence, but they have completely different semantics because of their different spatial configurations.",

Actually, a Chinese word usually consists of several characters, and each character can be further decomposed into a stroke sequence which is certain and changeless, and this kind of stroke sequence is very similar to the construction of English words. In Chinese, a particular sequence of strokes can reflect the inherent semantics. As shown in the upper half of Figure FIGREF3 , the Chinese character \u201c\u9a7e\" (drive) can be decomposed into a sequence of eight strokes, where the last three strokes together correspond to a root character \u201c\u9a6c\" (horse) similar to the root \u201cclar\" of English word \u201cdeclare\" and \u201cclarify\".",

This sample is based on related work for detecting users who have mentioned various pregnancy outcomes in their tweets. Two professional annotators manually categorized the $10,417$ users as \"bot,\" \"non-bot,\" or \"unavailable,\" based on their publicly available Twitter sites. Users were annotated broadly as \"bot\" if, in contrast to users annotated as \"non-bot,\" they do not appear to be posting personal information. Users were annotated as \"unavailable\" if their Twitter sites could not be viewed at the time of annotation, due to modifying their privacy settings or being removed or suspended from Twitter.

The training set includes $61,160,686$ tweets posted by 6610 users, and the held-out test set includes $15,703,735$ tweets posted by 1652 users. First, we evaluated Botometer on our held-out test set. Botometer is a publicly available bot detection system designed for political dot detection. It outputs a score between 0 and 1 for a user, representing the likelihood that a user is a bot. Second, we used the Botometer score for each user as a feature in training a gradient boosting classifier which is a decision tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm with gradient boosting BIBREF23 and can be used to address class imbalance. To adapt the Botometer scores to our binary classification task, we set the threshold to $0.47$, based on performing 5-fold cross validation over the training set. To further address the class imbalance, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)BIBREF24 to create artificial instances of \"bot\" users in the training set. We also performed 5-fold cross validation over the training set to optimize parameters for the classifier; we used exponential as the loss function, set the number of estimators to 200, and set the learning rate to $0.1$. Third, we used the classifier with an extended set of features that are not used by Botometer.

Although the classifier with only the Botometer score as a feature ($0.286$) performs even worse than the default Botometer system, our extended feature set significantly improves performance ($0.700$). For imbalanced data, a higher F$_1$-score for the majority class is typical; in this case, it reflects that we have modeled the detection of \"bot\" users based on their natural distribution in health-related data.",

        "In recent years, social media has evolved into an important source of information for various types of health-related research. Social networks encapsulate large volumes of data associated with diverse health topics, generated by active user bases in continuous growth. Twitter, for example, has 330 million monthly active users worldwide that generate almost 500 million micro-blogs (tweets) per day. For some years, the use of the platform to share personal health information has been growing, particularly amongst people living with one or more chronic conditions and those living with disability. Twenty percent of social network site users living with chronic conditions gather and share health information on the sites, compared with 12% of social network site users who report no chronic conditions. Social media data is thus being widely used for health-related research, for tasks such as adverse drug reaction detection BIBREF0, syndromic surveillance BIBREF1, subject recruitment for cancer trials BIBREF2, and characterizing drug abuse BIBREF3, to name a few. Twitter is particularly popular in research due to the availability of the public streaming API, which releases a sample of publicly posted data in real time. While early health-related research from social media focused almost exclusively on population-level studies, some very recent research tasks have focused on performing longitudinal data analysis at the user level, such as mining health-related information from cohorts of pregnant women BIBREF4.",
        "When conducting user-level studies from social media, one challenge is to ascertain the credibility of the information posted. Particularly, it is important to verify, when deriving statistical estimates from user cohorts, that the user accounts represent humans and not bots (accounts that can be controlled to automatically produce content and interact with other profiles)BIBREF5, BIBREF6. Bots may spread false information by automatically retweeting posts without a human verifying the facts or to influence public opinions on particular topics on purpose BIBREF5, BIBREF7, BIBREF8. For example, a recent study BIBREF9 showed that the highest proportion of anti-vaccine content is generated by accounts with unknown or intermediate bot scores, meaning that the existing methods were not able to fully determine if they were indeed bots. Automatic bot detection techniques mostly rely on extracting features from users' profiles and their social networks BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Some studies have used Honeypot profiles on Twitter to identify and analyze bots BIBREF12, while other studies have analyzed social proximity BIBREF13 or both social and content proximities BIBREF10, tweet timing intervals BIBREF14, or user-level content-based and graph-based features BIBREF15.

This sample is based on related work for detecting users who have mentioned various pregnancy outcomes in their tweets.

Users were annotated broadly as \"bot\" if, in contrast to users annotated as \"non-bot,\" they do not appear to be posting personal information. Users were annotated as \"unavailable\" if their Twitter sites could not be viewed at the time of annotation, due to modifying their privacy settings or being removed or suspended from Twitter. Based on 1000 overlapping annotations, their inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was $\\kappa $ = $0.93$ (Cohen\u2019s kappa BIBREF21), considered \"almost perfect agreement\" BIBREF22.

Therefore, in order to narrow down abstract sections that correspond to the P label, for example, we needed to find a subset of labels such as, but not limited to population, patients, and subjects. We performed a lemmatization of the abstract section labels in order to cluster similar categories such as subject and subjects. Using this approach, we carefully chose candidate labels for each P, I, and O, and manually looked at a small number of samples for each label to determine if text was representative.",
        "For sections with labels such as population and intervention, we created a mutli-label. We also included negative examples by taking sentences from sections with headings such as aim. Furthermore, we cleaned the remaining data with various approaches including, but not limited to, language identification, removal of missing values, cleaning unicode characters, and filtering for sequences between 5 and 200 words, inclusive.",
        "The present work resulted in the creation of a PIO elements dataset, PICONET, and a classification tool. These constitute an important component of our system of automatic mining of medical abstracts. We intend to extend the dataset to full medical articles. The model will be modified to take into account the higher complexity of full text data and more efficient features for model boosting will be investigated."

        "Since our goal was to collect sequences that are uniquely representative of a description of Population, Intervention, and Outcome, we avoided a keyword-based approach such as in BIBREF12 . For example, using a keyword-based approach would yield a sequence labeled population and methods with the label P, but such abstract sections were not purely about the population and contained information about the interventions and study design making them poor candidates for a P label. Thus, we were able to extract portions of abstracts pertaining to P, I, and O categories while minimizing ambiguity and redundancy. Moreover, in the dataset from BIBREF12 , a section labeled as P that contained more than one sentence would be split into multiple P sentences to be included in the dataset. We avoided this approach and kept the full abstract sections. The full abstracts were kept in conjunction with our belief that keeping the full section retains more feature-rich sequences for each sequence, and that individual sentences from long abstract sections can be poor candidates for the corresponding label.",
        "In this study, we introduce PICONET, a multi-label dataset consisting of sequences with labels Population/Problem (P), Intervention (I), and Outcome (O).

It is important to note that it is an unfair comparison because even though the datasets were curated using the same methodology, each language's dataset is different. It is possible, for example, that the examples we have for Basque are simply harder than they are for Portuguese.",
        "Following BIBREF17, we use the pre-trained BERT models from the original authors, but through the PyTorch implementation. BIBREF17 showed that in his experiments the base BERT model performed better than the larger model, so we restrict our attention to the base model. For English, we use the model trained only on English data, whereas for all other languages we use the multilingual model.",
        "Finally, we ask how BERT's performance is affected by distance between the controller and the target, as well as the number of distractors. Figure FIGREF15 shows BERT's performance, aggregated over all languages and types, as a function of the distance involved in the agreement, while figure FIGREF16 shows the same for number of distractors. There is a slight but consistent decrease in performance as the distance and the number of distractors increase. The decline in performance begins later in figure FIGREF16 but drops more rapidly once it does.",
        "In the design of our datasets, we followed two principles. First, we chose data sources that are available across multiple languages, because we are interested in cross-linguistic generality. The languages in this study are those with sufficiently large data sources that also appear in the multilingual BERT model. Second, we use naturally-occurring data (cf. BIBREF18).",
        "BIBREF17 adapted the experimental setup of BIBREF13, BIBREF11 and BIBREF18 to use the cloze test to assess BERT's sensitivity to number agreement in English subject-verb agreement relations. The results showed that the single-language BERT model performed surprisingly well at this task (above 80% accuracy in all experiments), even when there were multiple \u201cdistractors\u201d in the sentence (other nouns that differed from the subject in number). This suggests that BERT is actually learning to approximate structure-dependent computation, and not simply relying on flawed heuristics."

        "The agreement relation in (UNKREF2) is between a subject and its verb, but there are other types of agreement relations. In addition to subject-verb agreement, three other types of agreement relations are cross-linguistically common: agreement of noun with i) determiner, ii) attributive adjective and iii) predicate adjective BIBREF22. The latter two types are distinguished by whether the adjective modifies the noun within a noun phrase or whether it is predicated of the subject of a clause. The first two types are sometimes categorized as nominal concord rather than agreement, but for our purposes this is merely a difference in terminology.",
        "In all four types of agreement studied, the controller of the agreement is a noun or pronoun, while the target can be a determiner, adjective or verb. Because of this part-of-speech restriction, we chose to mask out the controller in every cloze example so that BERT is evaluated against the same vocabulary across all four types. This also means that we only need to collect feature data on nouns and pronouns.",

        "In the age of social media, offensive content online has become prevalent in recent years. There are many types of offensive content online such as racist and sexist posts and insults and threats targeted at individuals or groups. As such content increasingly occurs online, it has become a growing issue for online communities. This has come to the attention of social media platforms and authorities underlining the urgency to moderate and deal with such content. Several studies in NLP have approached offensive language identification applying machine learning and deep learning systems on annotated data to identify such content. Researchers in the field have worked with different definitions of offensive language with hate speech being the most studied among these types BIBREF0. BIBREF1 investigate the similarity between these sub-tasks. With a few noteworthy exceptions, most research so far has dealt with English, due to the availability of language resources. This gap in the literature recently started to be addressed with studies on Spanish BIBREF2, Hindi BIBREF3, and German BIBREF4, to name a few.",

The usefulness of character n-grams for abusive language detection was explored on the same dataset with three different methods BIBREF11. The most recent project expanded on existing ideas for defining offensive language and presented the OLID (Offensive Language Identification Dataset), a corpus of Twitter posts hierarchically annotated on three levels, whether they contain offensive language or not, whether the offense is targeted and finally, the target of the offense BIBREF5. A CNN (Convolutional neural network) deep learning approach outperformed every model trained, with pre-trained FastText embeddings and updateable embeddings learned by the model as features.

In this way, we do not consider an error when MagiCoder and the human expert use two different LLTs for representing the same adverse event. The use of the LLT level for reporting purpose and the PT level for analysis purpose is suggested also by MedDRA BIBREF5 . With common PT we mean the percentage of preferred terms retrieved by human reviewers that have been recognized also by MagiCoder. Reported performances are summarized also in FIGREF59 .

As dual notions of false positive and false negative, one can define correct results, i.e., true positive (TP) and true negative (TN): in our case, a true positive is a correctly returned LLT, and a true negative is an LLT which, correctly, has not been recognized as a solution.",

It is worth noting that this test simply estimates how much, for each report, the MagiCoder behavior is similar to the manual work, without considering the effective quality of the manual encoding. Clearly, as a set of official reports, revised and sent to RNF, we assume to deal with an high-quality encoding: notwithstanding, some errors in the human encoding possibly occur. Moreover, the query we perform to compare manual and automatic encoding is, obviously, quantitative. For each VigiSegn report, the query is able to detect common retrieved terms and terms returned either by the human expert or by MagiCoder. It is not able to fairly test redundancy errors: human experts make some encoding choices in order to avoid repetitions. Thus, an LLT INLINEFORM0 returned by MagiCoder that has not been selected by the expert because redundant is not truly a false positive.

        "Concurrently, it has been argued for mental health research that it would constitute a `valuable critical step' BIBREF10 to analyse first-hand accounts by individuals with lived experience of severe mental health issues in blog posts, tweets, and discussion forums. Several severe mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being relapse and symptom free for a sustained period of time BIBREF11 , is considered difficult to achieve BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 . Second, unlike for some other severe mental health difficulties, return to normal functioning is achievable given appropriate treatment BIBREF28 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF29 .",
        "A substantial body of qualitative and quantitative research has shown the importance of personal recovery for individuals diagnosed with BD BIBREF22 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF23 . Qualitative evidence mainly comes from (semi-)structured interviews and focus groups and has been criticised for small numbers of participants BIBREF10 , lacking complementary quantitative evidence from larger samples BIBREF32 . Some quantitative evidence stems from the standardised bipolar recovery questionnaire BIBREF30 and a randomised control trial for recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy BIBREF31 . Critically, previous research has taken place only in structured settings. What is more, the recovery concept emerged from research primarily conducted in English-speaking countries, mainly involving researchers and participants of Western ethnicity. This might have led to a lack of non-Western notions of wellbeing in the concept, such as those found in indigenous peoples BIBREF32 , limiting its the applicability to a general population. Indeed, the variation in BD prevalence rates from 0.1% in India to 4.4% in the US is striking. It has been shown that culture is an important factor in the diagnosis of BD BIBREF33 , as well as on the causes attributed to mental health difficulties in general and treatments considered appropriate BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 . While approaches to mental health classification from texts have long ignored the cultural dimension BIBREF36 , first studies show that online language of individuals affected by depression or related mental health difficulties differs significantly across cultures BIBREF37 , BIBREF36 .",

We think that a recovery approach as leading principle for national or global health service strategies, should be informed by voices of individuals as diverse as those it is supposed to serve. Therefore, we expect the proposed investigations of views on recovery by previously under-researched ethnic, language, and cultural groups to yield valuable insights on the appropriateness of the recovery approach for a wider population. The datasets collected in this project can serve as useful resources for future research. More generally, our social-media data-driven approach could be applied to investigate other areas of mental health if it proves successful in leading to relevant new insights.",

Quantitative methods are suitable to study observable behaviour such as language and yield more generalisable results by taking into account large samples. However, they fall short of capturing the subjective, idiosyncratic meaning of socially constructed reality, which is important when studying individuals' recovery experience BIBREF59 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , BIBREF60 .

As discussed in the introduction, personal recovery research suffers from a bias towards English-speaking Western individuals of white ethnicity.

SHI and CI can be further divided into many different types in terms of their forms. We briefly introduce the related background knowledge as follows.",
        "In general, a Chinese classical poem is a perfect combination of three aspects, i.e., form, sound, and meaning. Firstly, it must strictly obey a particular form which specifies the number of lines (i.e., sentences) in the poem and the number of characters in each line. Secondly, it must strictly obey a particular sound pattern which specifies the sound requirement for each character in every position of the poem. Lastly, it must be meaningful, i.e., with grammatical and semantic well-formedness for each line and, with thematic coherence and integrity throughout the poem. These three points form the universal principles for human poets to create Chinese classical poems.",
        "CI is another primary type of Chinese poetry. In contrast to SHI, CI has nearly one thousand forms. Each form of CI (it is called Cipai scholarly) is defined by a fixed number of lines for the poem and, a fixed number of characters for a particular line which usually varies for different lines. The above settings for different Cipai are very distinct, for instance, the Cipai of Busuanzi contains 8 lines and 44 characters, as shown in Figure 2, whereas the Cipai of Manjianghong contains 22 lines and 94 characters. The high diversity regarding the forms of CI further significantly increases the difficulty of poem composition.",

Preliminary experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

State-of-the-art systems for this task rely on recurrent neural networks BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, and hence require large amounts of annotated training data to achieve good performance. As gold annotated data is expensive and difficult to obtain BIBREF5, previous works focused on readily available scientific abstracts and used author-assigned keyphrases as a proxy for expert annotations. However, this poses two major issues: 1) neural models for keyphrase generation do not generalize well across domains, thus limiting their use in practice; 2) author-assigned keyphrases exhibit strong consistency issues that negatively impacts the model's performance. There is therefore a great need for annotated data from different sources, that is both sufficiently large to support the training of neural-based models and that comprises gold-standard labels provided by experts. In this study, we address this need by providing KPTimes, a dataset made of 279 923 news articles that comes with editor-assigned keyphrases."

        "Model performances for each dataset are reported in Table . Extractive baselines show the best results for KPCrowd and DUC-2001 which is not surprising given that these datasets exhibit the lowest ratio of absent keyphrases. Neural-based models obtain the greatest performance, but only for the dataset on which they were trained. We therefore see that these models do not generalize well across domains, confirming previous preliminary findings BIBREF2 and exacerbating the need for further research on this topic. Interestingly, CopyNews outperforms the other models on JPTimes and achieves very low scores for KPCrowd and DUC-2001, although all these datasets are from the same domain. This emphasizes the differences that exist between the reader- and editor-assigned gold standard. The score difference may be explained by the ratio of absent keyphrases that differs greatly between the reader-annotated datasets and JPTimes (see Table ), and thus question the use of these rather extractive datasets for evaluating keyphrase generation.",

When properly trained, this model was shown to be very effective in extracting keyphrases from scientific abstracts. CopyRNN has been further extended by BIBREF3 to include correlation constraints among keyphrases which we do not include here as it yields comparable results.",

This confirms previous observations that readers tend to assign keyphrases in an extractive fashion BIBREF12, which makes these datasets less suitable for the task at hand (keyphrase generation) but rather relevant for a purely extractive task (keyphrase extraction). Yet, author-assigned keyphrases commonly found in scientific paper datasets are not perfect either, as they are less constrained BIBREF13 and include seldom-used variants or misspellings that negatively impact performance.

        "We explored the KPTimes dataset to better understand how it stands out from the existing ones. First, we looked at how editors tag news articles. Figure illustrates the difference between the annotation behaviour of readers, authors and editors through the number of times that each unique keyphrase is used in the gold standard. We see that non-expert annotators use a larger, less controlled indexing vocabulary, in part because they lack the higher level of domain expertise that editors have. For example, we observe that frequent keyphrases in KPTimes are close to topic descriptors (e.g. \u201cBaseball\u201c, \u201cPolitics and Government\u201c) while those appearing only once are very precise (e.g. \u201cMarley's Cafe\u201c, \u201cCatherine E. Connelly\u201c). Annotations in KPTimes are arguably more uniform and consistent, through the use of tag suggestions, which, as we will soon discuss in \u00a7SECREF12, makes it easier for supervised approaches to learn a good model.",
        "Restricting ourselves to one source of data ensures the uniformity and consistency of annotation that is missing in the other datasets, but it may also make the trained model source-dependent and harm generalization. To monitor the model's ability to generalize, we gather a secondary source of data. We collected HTML pages from the Japan Times and processed them the same way as described above. 10K more news articles were gathered as the JPTimes dataset.",
        "Variants of keyphrases recovered from the metadata occur in 8% of the documents and represent 810 sets of variants in the KPTimes test split. These variants often refer to the same concept (e.g. \u201cMarijuana; Pot; Weed\u201c), but can sometimes be simply semantically related (e.g. \u201cBridges; Tunnels\u201c). Thereafter, keyphrase variants will be used during model evaluation for reducing the number of mismatches associated with commonly used lexical overlap metrics.",

        "Next, we further looked at the characteristics of the gold keyphrases in KPTimes. Table shows that the number of gold keyphrases per document is similar to the one observed for KP20k while the number of missing keyphrases is higher. This indicates that editors are more likely to generalize and assign keyphrases that do not occur in the document ($\\approx 55\\%$). It is therefore this ability to generalize that models should mimic in order to perform well on KPTimes. We also note that keyphrases are on average shorter in news datasets ($1.5$ words) than those in scientific paper datasets ($2.4$ words). This may be due to the abundant use of longer, more specific phrases in scholarly documents BIBREF14."

Each column of the matrix is an embedding vector associated with a word in the vocabulary and each row of the matrix represents a latent feature. These vectors can subsequently be used to initialize the input layer of a neural network or some other NLP model.

Based on our intuition and supported by some of our preliminary experiments, this deficiency stems from an important factor in our BLSTM network. Since no sense embedding is made publicly available for use, the sense embeddings are initialized randomly; yet, word embeddings are initialized by pre-trained GloVe vectors in order to benefit from the semantic and syntactic properties of the context words conveyed by these embeddings. That is to say, the separate spaces that the sense embeddings and the (context) word embeddings come from enforces some delay for the alignment of these spaces which in turn demands more training data. Furthermore, this early misalignment does not allow the BLSTM fully take advantage of larger context sizes which can be helpful. Our first attempt to deal with such problem was to pre-train the sense embeddings by some techniques - such as taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) definition content words of senses, or taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) context words in their training samples - did not give us a better result than our random initialization. Our preliminary experiments though in which we replaced all GloVe embeddings in the network with sense embeddings (using a method proposed by Chen et al. BIBREF11 ), showed considerable improvements in the results of some ambiguous words. That means both senses and context words (while they can be ambiguous by themselves) come from one vector space. In other words, the context would also be represented by the possible senses that its words can take. This idea not only can help to improve the results of the current model, it can also avoid the need for a large amount of training data since senses can be seen in both places, center and context, to be trained."

For the restricted track, the organizers provided 1.2M pairs (560K without identity mappings) of corrected and uncorrected sentences.

Our contributions on this track focus on NMT training techniques such as over-sampling, back-translation, and fine-tuning. We show that over-sampling effectively reduces domain mismatch. We found back-translation BIBREF5 to be a very effective technique to utilize unannotated training data. However, while over-sampling is commonly used in machine translation to balance the number of real and back-translated training sentences, we report that using over-sampling this way for GEC hurts performance.

In practice, we identify subjective bias via the method of BIBREF2: using Wikipedia's neutral point of view (NPOV) policy. This policy is a set of principles which includes \u201cavoiding stating opinions as facts\u201d and \u201cpreferring nonjudgemental language\u201d.",
        "Overall, while modular does a better job at reducing bias, concurrent appears to better preserve the meaning and fluency of the original text. We conclude that the proposed methods, while imperfect, are capable of providing useful suggestions for how subjective bias in real-world news or political text can be reduced."

Sequential motion of specific body locations (such as hand-tip, neck and arm) provide informative cues about a sign. Using video data, it is difficult to extract different body locations and associated motion sequences from a series of RGB frames. Microsoft Kinect is a 3D camera sensor which can use the depth information of a person to capture 3D coordinates of his/her body location across a video.

However, the basic RNN has problems dealing with long term dependencies in data due to the vanishing gradient problem BIBREF21. Some solutions to the vanishing gradient problem involve careful initialization of network parameters or early stopping BIBREF22. But the most effective solution is to modify the RNN architecture in such a way that there exists a memory state (cell state) at every time step that can identify what to remember and what to forget. This architecture is referred to as long short term memory (LSTM) network BIBREF23. While the basic RNN is a direct transformation of the previous state and the current input, the LSTM maintains an internal memory and has mechanisms to update and use that memory. This is achieved by deploying four separate neural networks also called gates. Figure FIGREF12 depicts a cell of an LSTM network which shows input at the current time step ${x_t}$ and the previous state ${h_{t-1}}$ enter into the cell; and get concatenated.

Properties such as references between articles or structured relations in legal sentences should be investigated more deeply. In addition, there should be more evaluation of SVM-Rank and other L2R methods to observe how they perform on this legal data using the same feature set. These are left as our future work.",
        "There are two primary approaches to information retrieval (IR) in the legal domain BIBREF0 : manual knowledge engineering (KE) and natural language processing (NLP). In the KE approach, an effort is put into translating the way legal experts remember and classify cases into data structures and algorithms, which will be used for information retrieval. Although this approach often yields a good result, it is hard to be applied in practice because of time and financial cost when building the knowledge base. In contrast, NLP-based IR systems are more practical as they are designed to quickly process terabytes of data by utilizing NLP techniques. However, several challenges are presented when designing such system. For example, factors and concepts in legal language are applied in a different way from common usage BIBREF1 . Hence, in order to effectively answer a legal question, it must compare the semantic connections between the question and sentences in relevant articles found in advance BIBREF2 ."

Irony factors are characteristics of ironic utterances that cannot be removed without destroying the irony. In contrast, irony markers are a meta-communicative clue that \u201calert the reader to the fact that a sentence is ironical\u201d BIBREF4 . They can be removed and the utterance is still ironic."

Taking our in-house KB of power tool domain as an example, template \u201chow to use #X#\u201d is first constructed for predicate \u201cperformsActivity\u201d. In addition, seed question \u201chow to use jigsaw\u201d is generated by applying the template on triple \u201c $\\langle $ jigsaw, performsActivity, CurveCut $\\rangle $ \u201d, before finally questions (Figure 2 ) are retrieved from Google with the seed question.",
        "We propose a system for generating questions from KB that significantly reduces the human effort by leveraging the massive web resources. Given a KB, a small set of question templates are first hand-crafted based on the predicates in the KB. These templates consist of a transcription of the predicate in the KB (e.g. performsActivity $\\Rightarrow $ how to) and placeholders for the subject (#X#) and the object (#Y#). A seed question set is then generated by applying the templates on the KB. The seed question set is further expanded through a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing), by iteratively forming each generated question as a search query to retrieve more related question candidates. Finally a selection step is applied by estimating the fluency and domain relevance of each question candidate.",
        "The only human labor in this work is the question template construction. Our system does not require a large number of templates because: (1) the iterative question expansion can produce a large number of questions even with a relatively small number of seed questions, as we see in the experiments, (2) multiple entities in the KB share the same predicates. Another advantage is that our system can easily generate updated questions as web is self-updating consistently. In our experiment, we compare with serban-EtAl:2016:P16-1 on 500 random selected triples from Freebase BIBREF7 . Evaluated by 3 human graders, questions generated by our system are significantly better then serban-EtAl:2016:P16-1 on grammaticality and naturalness.",
        "We generate 12,228 seed questions from which 20,000 more questions are expanded with Google. Shown in Table 4 are some expanded questions from which we can see that most of them are grammatical and relevant to the power tool domain. In addition, most questions are informative and correspond to a specific answer, except the one \u201cdo I need a hammer drill\u201d that lacks context information. Finally, in addition to the simple factoid questions, our system generates many complex questions such as \u201chow to cut a groove in wood without a router\u201d."

First, Target Price (TP) and (TP+LP)/2 prove to be strong baselines, with the latter achieving $61.07\\%$ Accuracy$\\pm 10$. This performance is also attested by relatively strong numbers on the other metrics as well. Prices-only, which does not incorporate any knowledge from natural language, fails to beat the average baseline even with $60\\%$ of the negotiation history. This can be attributed to the observation that in many negotiations, before discussing the price, buyers tend to get more information about the product by exchanging messages: what is the condition of the product, how old it is, is there an urgency for any of the buyer/seller and so on. Incorporating natural language in both the scenario and event messages paves the way to leverage such cues and make better predictions early on in the conversation, as depicted in the plots. Both BERT and BERT-GRU consistently perform well on the complete test set. There is no clear winner, although using a recurrent network proves to be more helpful in the early stages of the negotiation. Note that BERT method still employs multiple [SEP] tokens along with alternating segment embeddings (Section SECREF3). Without this usage, the fine-tuning pipeline proves to be inadequate. Overall, BERT-GRU achieves $67.08\\%$ Accuracy$\\pm 10$ with just the product scenario, reaching to $71.16\\%$ with $60\\%$ of the messages and crosses $90\\%$ as more information about the final price is revealed.

        "In Fig. FIGREF14 , the cosine similarities of the segment pairs get smaller as the edit distances increase, and the trend is observed in all languages. The gap between each edit distance groups, i.e. (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), is obvious. This means that INLINEFORM0 learned from English can successfully encode the sequential phonetic structures into fixed-length vector for the target languages to some good extend even though it has never seen any audio data of the target languages. Another interesting fact is the corresponding variance between languages. In the source language, English, the variances of the five edit distance groups are fixed at 0.030, which means that the cosine similarity in each edit distance group is centralized. However, the variances of the groups in the target languages vary. In French and German, the variance grows from 0.030 to 0.060 as the edit distance increases from 0 to 4. For Czech/Spanish, the variance starts at a larger value of 0.040/0.050 and increases to 0.050/0.073. We suspect that the fluctuating variance is related to the similarity between languages. English, German and French are more similar compared with Czech and Spanish.

It is demonstrated that the segmentation of lengthy documents into smaller chunks of text allows the context of each document to be encapsulated in an improved way, leading to enhanced results. The intuition behind this idea was formed by investigating automatic audio segmentation research. Audio segmentation (also known as audio classification) is an essential pre-processing step in audio analysis that separates different types of sound (e.g. speech, music, silence etc.) and splits audio signals into chunks in order to further improve the comprehension of these signals BIBREF7. Analogously, the present paper shows that splitting overly lengthy legal documents into smaller parts before processing them, boosts the final results."

In comparison, our approach repeatedly scores the entire source for each target prefix, resulting in $O(mn)$ runtime. Although our approach has greater time complexity, the practical difference of scoring the tokens of a single source sentence instead of just one token is likely to be negligible on modern GPUs since all source tokens can be scored in parallel. Inference is mostly slowed down by the autoregressive nature of decoding. Scoring the entire source enables capturing more dependencies between the source and target, since the beginning of the target must explain the entire source, not just the beginning. This is especially critical when the word order between the source and target language varies considerably, and likely accounts for the lower performance of the direct model of BIBREF9 in comparison to a standard seq2seq model.",

CEFR proposes six levels of language proficiency: A1 (beginner), A2 (elementary), B1 (intermediate), B2 (upper intermediate), C1 (advanced) and C2 (proficient). Since sentences are a common unit in language exercises, but remain less explored in the readability literature, we also investigate the applicability of our approach to sentences, performing a 5-way classification (levels A1-C1). Our document-level model achieves a state-of-the-art performance (F-score of 0.8), however, there is room for improvement in sentence-level predictions.

For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions.

The target languages are English (from the Buckeye corpus BIBREF38 ) and Xitsonga (NCHLT corpus BIBREF39 ). Table TABREF8 includes the corpus statistics. These corpora are not split into train/dev/test; since training is unsupervised, the system is simply trained directly on the unlabeled test set (which could also be done in deployment).

In contrast, the same-different task always compares whole words and directly evaluates how good feature representations are at telling whether two utterances are the same word or not. Thus it has an immediate link to applications like spoken term detection and it allows easier error analysis. It is also faster to prepare the same-different evaluation set and run the evaluation.

The effects of vtln are mostly confined to reducing both gender and speaker purity of the identified clusters (which is desirable) while maintaining the performance on other metrics. This means that the learned representations have become more invariant to variation in speaker and gender, which is exactly what vtln aims to do.

In order to evaluate the benefit of the proposed private cache to store the personalized language model, we group multiple utterances from a user into virtual dialog sessions of one, two, or five turns.",
        "The calculation for composition is very slow for LM with large vocabulary size. Naive on-the-fly composition is very time-consuming. In BIBREF3, the authors proposed a pre-initialized composition algorithm, which does a partial composition based on the state frequency. This one-time cost calculation can do some composition in advance. During decoding search, the FST will skip the composition of pre-initialized states. However, extending this algorithm to class LMs is non-trivial in practice. For a class LM, the non-terminal states cannot be composed during pre-initialization since we need a pre-initialization that is applicable to all users, which means we need to apply some restrictions to prevent composition of the personalized part.",
        "In this work, we propose new methods for improving the efficiency of dynamic WFST decoding with personalized language models. Experimental results show that using a pre-composed graph can reduce the RTF by a factor of three compared with a fully dynamic graph. Moreover, in multi-utterance dialog sessions, the RTF can be reduced by a factor of 5 using the proposed private cache without harming WER. Though a fully dynamic graph uses less memory for the graph, the pre-composed graph has a better marginal memory cost, which is more memory efficient in large-scale production services that need to support a large number of concurrent requests."

This concept has a straightforward application to our task: knowing that members of a particular community are prone to creating hateful content, and knowing that the author p is connected to this community, we can leverage information beyond linguistic cues and more accurately predict the use of hateful/non-hateful language from $p$ . The questions that we seek to address here are: are some authors, and the respective communities that they belong to, more hateful than the others?

        "This work proposed a set of elementary property prediction tasks to understand different tweet representations in an application independent, fine-grained fashion. The open nature of social media not only poses a plethora of opportunities to understand the basic characteristics of the posts, but also helped us draw novel insights about different representation models. We observed that among supervised models, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM encapsulates most of the syntactic and social properties with a great accuracy, while BOW, DSSM, STV and T2V does that among the unsupervised models. Tweet length affects the task prediction accuracies, but we found that all models behave similarly under variation in tweet length. Finally while LDA is insensitive to input word order, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM are extremely sensitive to word order.",
        "Essentially we ask the following question: \u201cWhat are the core properties encoded in the given tweet representation?\u201d. We explicitly group the set of these properties into two categories: syntactic and social. Syntactic category includes properties such as tweet length, the order of words in it, the words themselves, slang words, hashtags and named entities in the tweet. On the other hand, social properties consist of `is reply', and `reply time'. We investigate the degree to which the tweet representations encode these properties. We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task). In this work we perform an extensive evaluation of 9 unsupervised and 4 supervised tweet representation models, using 8 different properties. The most relevant work is that of Adi et al. [5], which investigates three sentence properties in comparing unsupervised sentence representation models such as average of words vectors and LSTM auto-encoders. We differ from their work in two ways: (1) While they focus on sentences, we focus on social media posts which opens up the challenge of considering multiple salient properties such as hashtags, named entities, conversations and so on. (2) While they work with only unsupervised representation-learning models, we investigate the traditional unsupervised methods (BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW, Tweet2Vec), as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM).",

        "Here, we first show that the beam problem is indeed the brevity problem. We then demonstrate that solving the length problem does solve the beam problem. Tables TABREF10 , TABREF11 , and TABREF12 show the results of our German\u2013English, Russian\u2013English, and French\u2013English systems respectively. Each table looks at the impact on BLEU, METEOR, and the ratio of the lengths of generated sentences compared to the gold lengths BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . The baseline method is a standard model without any length correction. The reward method is the tuned constant word reward discussed in the previous section. Norm refers to the normalization method, where a hypothesis' score is divided by its length.",
        "To our knowledge, there are three methods in common use for adjusting the model to favor longer sentences.",
        "Another way to demonstrate that the beam problem is the same as the brevity problem is to look at the translations generated by baseline systems on shorter sentences. Figure FIGREF18 shows the BLEU scores of the Russian\u2013English system for beams of size 10 and 1000 on sentences of varying lengths, with and without correcting lengths. The x-axes of the figure are cumulative: length 20 includes sentences of length 0\u201320, while length 10 includes 0\u201310. It is worth noting that BLEU is a word-level metric, but the systems were built using BPE; so the sequences actually generated are longer than the x-axes would suggest.",
        "We have argued that the brevity problem is an example of label bias, and that the solution is a very limited form of globally-normalized model. These can be seen as the simplest case of the more general problem of label bias and the more general solution of globally-normalized models for NMT BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF26 , BIBREF13 . Some questions for future research are:",
        "The top sections of Tables TABREF10 , TABREF11 , TABREF12 illustrate the brevity and beam problems in the baseline models. As beam size increases, the BLEU and METEOR scores drop significantly. This is due to the brevity problem, which is illustrated by the length ratio numbers that also drop with increased beam size. For larger beam sizes, the length of the generated output sentences are a fraction of the lengths of the correct translations. For the lower-resource French\u2013English task, the drop is more than 8 BLEU when increasing the beam size from 10 to 150. The issue is even more evident in our Russian-English system where we increase the beam to 1000 and BLEU scores drop by more than 20 points."

        "We have explored simple and effective ways to alleviate or eliminate the beam problem. We showed that the beam problem can largely be explained by the brevity problem, which results from the locally-normalized structure of the model. We compared two corrections to the model and introduced a method to learn the parameters of these corrections. Because this method is helpful and easy, we hope to see it included to make stronger baseline NMT systems.",
        "To address the brevity problem, many designers of NMT systems add corrections to the model. These corrections are often presented as modifications to the search procedure. But, in our view, the brevity problem is essentially a modeling problem, and these corrections should be seen as modifications to the model (Section SECREF5 ). Furthermore, since the root of the problem is local normalization, our view is that these modifications should be trained as globally-normalized models (Section SECREF6 ).",
        "In this example, INLINEFORM0 , even though overestimated, is still lower than INLINEFORM1 , and wins only because its suffixes have higher probability. Greedy search would prune the incorrect prefix an and yield the correct output. In general, then, we might expect greedy or beam search to alleviate some symptoms of label bias. Namely, a prefix with a low-entropy suffix distribution can be pruned if its probability is, even though overestimated, not among the highest probabilities. Such an observation was made by BIBREF11 in the context of dependency parsing, and we will see next that precisely such a situation affects output length in NMT.",
        "We note that the beam problem in NMT exists for relatively small beam sizes \u2013 especially when compared to traditional beam sizes in SMT systems. On our medium-resource Russian\u2013English system, we investigate the full impact of this problem using a much larger beam size of 1000. In Table TABREF10 , we can see that the beam problem is particularly pronounced. The first row of the table shows the uncorrected, baseline score. From a beam of 10 to a beam of 1000, the drop in BLEU scores is over 20 points. This is largely due to the brevity problem discussed earlier. The second row of the table shows the length of the translated outputs compared to the lengths of the correct translations. Though the problem persists even at a beam size of 10, at a beam size of 1000, our baseline system generates less than one third the number of words that are in the correct translations. Furthermore, 37.3% of our translated outputs have sentences of length 0. In other words, the most likely translation is to immediately generate the stop symbol. This is the problem visualized in Figure FIGREF4 .",
        "First, machine translation systems rely on heuristics to search through the intractably large space of possible translations. Most commonly, beam search is used during the decoding process. Traditional statistical machine translation systems often rely on large beams to find good translations. However, in neural machine translation, increasing the beam size has been shown to degrade performance. This is the last of the six challenges identified by BIBREF0 ."

The goal of attention mechanisms in such tasks is to derive context vectors which capture relevant source side information and help predict the current target representation. The sequence of annotations generated by the encoder to come up with a context vector capturing how each sub-word contributes to the record's clickbait quotient is of paramount importance to this model.

Participants compared summaries produced from the best extractive baseline (SummaRunner), and the best EA- and CA-based systems (SummaRunner+S2S+Copy and AE+Att+Copy+Salient, respectively). As an upper bound, we also included Gold standard summaries. The study was conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS; BIBREF42), a less labor-intensive alternative to paired comparisons that has been shown to produce more reliable results than rating scales BIBREF43. Specifically, participants were shown the movie title and basic background information (i.e., synopsis, release year, genre, director, and cast). They were also presented with three system summaries and asked to select the best and worst among them according to Informativeness (i.e., does the summary convey opinions about specific aspects of the movie in a concise manner?), Correctness (i.e., is the information in the summary factually accurate and does it correspond to the information given about the movie?), and Grammaticality (i.e., is the summary fluent and grammatical?). Examples of system summaries are shown in Figure FIGREF1 and Figure FIGREF37. We randomly selected 50 movies from the test set and compared all possible combinations of summary triples for each movie. We collected three judgments for each comparison. The order of summaries and movies was randomized per participant. The score of a system was computed as the percentage of times it was chosen as best minus the percentage of times it was selected as worst. The scores range from -1 (worst) to 1 (best) and are shown in Table TABREF36. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the human-generated gold summaries were considered best, whereas our model (AE+Att+Copy+Salient) was ranked second, indicating that humans find its output more informative, correct, and grammatical compared to other systems. SummaRunner was ranked third followed by SummaRunner+S2S+Copy. We inspected the summaries produced by the latter system and found they were factually incorrect bearing little correspondence to the movie (examples shown in Figure FIGREF37), possibly due to the huge information loss at the extraction stage.

Overall, we observe that AE+Att+Copy is able to customize summaries to a great extent. In all cases, crowdworkers perceive a significant increase in the proportion of aspect $x$ when using Cust($x$). AE+Att+Copy+Salient is unable to generate need-specific summaries, showing no discernible difference between generic and customized summaries. This shows that the use of an extractive module, which is used as one of the main components of EA-based approaches, limits the flexibility of the abstractive model to customize summaries based on a user need.",
        "We further assessed the ability of CA-based systems to generate customized summaries at test time. As discussed earlier, customization at test time is not trivially possible for EA-based systems and as a result we cannot compare against them. Instead, we evaluate two CA-based systems, namely AE+Att+Copy and AE+Att+Copy+Salient. Similar to EA-based systems, the latter biases summary generation towards the $k$ most salient extracted opinions using an additional extractive module, which may not contain information relevant to the user's need (we set $k=5$ in our experiments). We thus expect this model to be less effective for customization than AE+Att+Copy which makes no assumptions regarding which summaries to consider. In this experiment, we assume users may wish to control the output summaries in four ways focusing on acting- and plot-related aspects of a movie review, as well as its sentiment, which may be positive or negative. Let Cust($x$) be the zero-shot customization technique discussed in the previous section, where $x$ is an information need (i.e., acting, plot, positive, or negative). We sampled a small set of background reviews $C_x$ ($|C_x|$=1,000) from a corpus of 1 million reviews covering 7,500 movies from the Rotten Tomatoes website, made available in BIBREF29. The reviews contain sentiment labels provided by their authors and heuristically classified aspect labels. We then ran Cust($x$) using both AE+Att+Copy and AE+Att+Copy+Salient models. We show in Figure FIGREF37 customized summaries generated by the two models. To determine which system is better at customization, we again conducted a judgment elicitation study on AMT. Participants read a summary which was created by a general-purpose system or its customized variant. They were then asked to decide if the summary is generic or focuses on a specific aspect (plot or acting) and expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. We selected 50 movies (from the test set) which had mixed reviews and collected judgements from three different participants per summary. The summaries were presented in random order per participant.",
        "The proliferation of opinions expressed in online reviews, blogs, internet forums, and social media has created a pressing need for automated systems which enable customers, companies, or service providers to make informed decisions without having to absorb large amounts of opinionated text. Opinion summarization is the task of automatically generating summaries for a set of opinions about a specific target BIBREF0. Figure FIGREF1 shows various reviews about the movie \u201cCoach Carter\u201d and example summaries generated by humans and automatic systems. The vast majority of previous work BIBREF1 views opinion summarization as the final stage of a three-step process involving: (1) aspect extraction (i.e., finding features pertaining to the target of interest, such as battery life or sound quality); (2) sentiment prediction (i.e., determining the sentiment of the extracted aspects); and (3) summary generation (i.e., presenting the identified opinions to the user). Textual summaries are created following mostly extractive methods which select representative segments (usually sentences) from the source text BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Despite being less popular, abstractive approaches seem more appropriate for the task at hand as they attempt to generate summaries which are maximally informative and minimally redundant without simply rearranging passages from the original opinions BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. General-purpose summarization approaches have recently shown promising results with end-to-end models which are data-driven and take advantage of the success of sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures. Most approaches BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13 encode documents and then decode the learned representations into an abstractive summary, often by attending to the source input BIBREF14 and copying words from it BIBREF15. Under this modeling paradigm, it is no longer necessary to identify aspects and their sentiment for the opinion summarization task, as these are learned indirectly from training data (i.e., sets of opinions and their corresponding summaries). These models are usually tested on domains where the input is either one document or a small set of documents. However, the number of opinions tends to be very large (150 for the example in Figure FIGREF1). It is therefore practically unfeasible to train a model in an end-to-end fashion, given the memory limitations of modern hardware. As a result, current approaches BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19 sacrifice end-to-end elegance in favor of a two-stage framework which we call Extract-Abstract: an extractive model first selects a subset of opinions and an abstractive model then generates the summary while conditioning on the extracted subset (see Figure FIGREF5). The extractive pass unfortunately has two drawbacks. Firstly, on account of having access to a subset of opinions, the summaries can be less informative and inaccurate, as shown in Figure FIGREF1. And secondly, user preferences cannot be easily taken into account (e.g., the reader may wish to obtain a summary focusing on the acting or plot of a movie as opposed to a general-purpose summary) since more specialized information might have been removed."

This is attributed to the fact they assigned high similarity scores to not so semantically related sentences.

In other words, at each iteration $i$ , we compute the metrics over $\\tilde{E}_i = \\lbrace e_1, \\dots , e_i\\rbrace $ . Figure 2 shows the partial TCT value on the most important 10,000 entities for $N=\\lbrace 1,10\\rbrace $ according to the ranks computed by BIBREF26 . Here, KG2Vec maintains a higher index than the other two approaches, despite these are steadily increasing after the $\\sim 2,000$ th entity. We interpret the lower TCT for the top $2,000$ entities as noise produced by the fact that these nodes are hyperconnected to the rest of the graph, therefore it is hard for them to remain close to their type peers. In Figures 2 and 3 , the TCT and NST metrics respectively are computed on 10,000 random entities. In both cases, the values for the two settings of all approaches stabilize after around $1,000$ entities, however we clearly see that RDF2Vec embeddings achieve the highest distributional quality by type and category. The higher number of occurrences per entity in the huge corpus of random walks in RDF2Vec might be the reason of this result for rarer entities.",

They thought that it may be because the adversarial training strategy is more beneficial to tasks in which there is a big discrepancy between the distributions of the generated sequences and the reference target sequences (that is, the adversarial approach may be more beneficial on tasks in which entropy of the targets is high). In the future, this relationship can be further explored."

        "They achieved this by casting the conversation modelling task, as a task of predicting the next sequence given the previous sequence using recurrent networks. This simple approach truly changed the conversation agent landscape. Most of the state-of-the-art today is built on their success. In a nutshell the input utterance is input to an encoder network, which is a recurrent neural network (RNN) in this case, but as we will see Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) BIBREF12 have since replaced RNNs as the standard for this task. The encoder summarizes the input utterance into a fixed length vector representation which is input to the decoder, which itself is again a RNN. The paper looks at this fixed vector as the thought vector - which hold the most important information of the input utterance. The Decoder netwroks takes this as input and output's an output utterance word-by-word until it generates an end-of-speech INLINEFORM0 token. This approach allows for variable length inputs and outputs. The network is jointly trained on two turn conversations. Figure FIGREF3 shows the sequence to sequence neural conversation model.",
        "Although they did not evaluate their model on some standard metric, they showed that their model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion. In the future, instead of specifying an emotion class, the model should decide the most appropriate emotion category for the response. However, this may be challenging since such a task depends on the topic, context or the mood of the user.",
        "In this survey paper we explored the exciting and rapidly changing field of conversational agents. We talked about the early rule-based methods that depended on hand-engineered features. These methods laid the ground work for the current models. However these models were expensive to create and the features depended on the domain that the conversational agent was created for. It was hard to modify these models for a new domain. As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents. Sequence to sequence model created in 2015 was capable of handling utterances of variable lengths, the application of sequence to sequence to conversation agents truly revolutionized the domain. After this advancement the field has literally exploded with numerous application in the last couple of years. The results have been impressive enough to find their way into commercial applications such that these agents have become truly ubiquitous. We attempt to present a broad view of these advancements with a focus on the main challenges encountered by the conversational agents and how these new approaches are trying to mitigate them.",

On the other hand we have non-goal-driven systems which are also referred to as chit-chat models. There is no explicit purpose for interacting with these agents other than entertainment. Compared to goal oriented dialog systems where the universe is limited to an application, building open-ended chit-chat models is more challenging. Non-goal oriented agents are a good indication of the state of the art of artificial intelligence according to the Turing test. With no grounding in common sense and no sense of context these agents have to fall back on canned responses and resort to internet searches now.

Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8.

First, the group seemed to think that encodings would be needed, but it seems that entropy-based encodings and calculations added no real benefits (i.e. added no benefit that would not be offset by the cost of calculating the codes). In addition, Finka and Laszlo BIBREF10 seem to place great emphasis on lemmatization instead of stemming, which, if they had constructed a prototype, they would have noticed it to be very hard to tackle with the technology of the age. Nevertheless, the idea of proper lemmatization would probably be replaced with moderately precise hard-coded stemming, made with the help of the \"inverse dictionary\", which Finka and Laszlo proposed as one of the key tasks in their 1962 paper. This paper also highlights the need for a frequency count and taking only the most frequent words, which is an approach that later became widely used in the natural language processing community. Sentential alignment coupled with part-of-speech tagging was correctly identified as one of the key aspects of machine translation, but its complexity was severely underestimated by the group. One might argue that these two modules are actually everything that is needed for a successful machine translation system, which shows the complexity of the task."

The question is whether Laszlo's idea of cybernetics would drive the research of the group towards artificial neural networks. Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\". This seems to suggest that they were aware of the efforts of logicians (such as Bar Hillel, and to some degree Pitts, since Wiener specifically mentions logicians-turned-cyberneticists in his book BIBREF13), but still concluded that a cybernetic approach would probably be a better choice.",

Perhaps the most important unrealized point of contact between machine translation and cybernetics happened in the winter of 1950/51. In that period, Bar-Hillel met Rudolf Carnap in Chicago, who introduced to him the (new) idea of cybernetics. Also, Carnap gave him the contact details of his former teaching assistant, Walter Pitts, who was at that moment with Norbert Wiener at MIT and who was supposed to introduce him to Wiener, but the meeting never took place BIBREF3. Nevertheless, Bar-Hillel was to stay at MIT where he, inspired by cybernetics, would go to organize the first machine translation conference in the world in 1952 BIBREF3.",
        "As noted earlier, the group had no computer available to build a prototype, and subsequently, they have underestimated the complexity of determining sentential alignment. Sentential alignment seems rather trivial from a theoretical standpoint, but it could be argued that machine translation can be reduced to sentential alignment. This reduction vividly suggests the full complexity of sentential alignment. But the complexity of alignment was not evident at the time, and only several decades after the Croatian group's dissolution, in the late 1990s, did the group centered around Tillmann and Ney start to experiment with statistical models using (non-trivial) alignment modules, and producing state-of-the-art results (cf. BIBREF24) and BIBREF25. However, this was statistical learning, and it would take another two decades for sentential alignment to be implemented in cybernetic models, by then known under a new name, deep learning. Alignment was implemented in deep neural networks by BIBREF26 and BIBREF27, but a better approach, called attention, which is a trainable alignment module, was being developed in parallel, starting with the seminal paper on attention in computer vision by BIBREF28.",

        "The idea of machine translation was a tempting idea in the 1950s. The main military interest in machine translation as an intelligence gathering tool (translation of scientific papers, daily press, technical reports, and everything the intelligence services could get their hands on) was sparked by the Soviet advance in nuclear technology, and would later be compounded by the success of Vostok 1 (termed by the USA as a \u201cstrategic surprise\u201d). In the nuclear age, being able to read and understand what the other side was working on was of crucial importance BIBREF4. Machine translation was quickly absorbed in the program of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956 (where Artificial Intelligence as a field was born), as one of the five core fields of artificial intelligence (later to be known as natural language processing). One other field was included here, the \u201cnerve nets\u201d as they were known back then, today commonly known as artificial neural networks. What is also essential for our discussion is that the earliest programming language for artificial intelligence, Lisp, was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy BIBREF5. But let us take a closer look at the history of machine translation. In the USA, the first major wave of government and military funding for machine translation came in 1954, and the period of abundancy lasted until 1964, when the National Research Council established the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC), which was to assess the results of the ten years of intense funding. The findings were very negative, and funding was almost gone BIBREF4, hence the ALPAC report became the catalyst for the first \u201cAI Winter\u201d.",

It is not clear whether Finka means character bigrams, which was computationally feasible at the time, or word bigrams, which was not feasible, but the suggestion of modelling the word context does point in this direction. Even though the beginnings of using character bigrams can be traced back to Claude Shannon BIBREF21, using character-level bigrams in natural language processing was studied extensively only by Gilbert and Moore BIBREF22. It can be argued, that in a sense, Matkovi\u0107 predated these results, but his research and ideas were not known in the west, and he was not cited. The successful use of word bigrams in text classification had to wait until BIBREF23. The long time it took to get from character to words was mainly due to computational limitations, but Matkovi\u0107's ideas are not to be dismissed lightly on account of computational complexity, since the idea of using word bigrams was being explored by the Croatian group\u2013perhaps the reason for considering such an idea was the lack of a computer and the underestimation of the memory requirements. The whole process described above is illustrated in Fig. 1.",
        "At this point, we are leaving the historical analysis behind to speculate on what the group might have discovered if they had had access to a computer. First of all, did the Croatian group have a concrete idea for tackling alignment? Not really. However, an approach can be read between the lines of primarily BIBREF16 and BIBREF17. In BIBREF17, Prani\u0107 addresses the Soviet model by Andreev, looking at it as if it was composed of two modules \u2013 an understanding module and a generation module. Following the footsteps of Andreev, their interaction should be over an idealized language. Laszlo BIBREF16 notes that such an idealized language should be encoded by keeping the entropy in mind. He literally calls for using entropy to eliminate redundancy while translating to an artificial language, and as Muli\u0107 notes BIBREF7, Andreev's idea (which should be followed) was to use an artificial language as an intermediary language, which has all the essential structures of all the languages one wishes to translate.",

        "In Yugoslavia, organized effort in machine translation started in 1959, but the first individual effort was made by Vladimir Matkovi\u0107 from the Institute for Telecommunications in Zagreb in 1957 in his PhD thesis on entropy in the Croatian language BIBREF10. The main research group in machine translation was formed in 1958, at the Circle for Young Linguists in Zagreb, initiated by a young linguist Bulcsu Laszlo, who graduated in Russian language, Southern Slavic languages and English language and literature at the University of Zagreb in 1952. The majority of the group members came from different departments of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb, with several individuals from other institutions. The members from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences were: Svetozar Petrovi\u0107 (Department of Comparative Literature), Stjepan Babi\u0107 (Department of Serbo-Croatian Language and Literature), Krunoslav Pranji\u0107 (Department of Serbo-Croatian Language and Literature), \u017deljko Bujas (Department of English Language and Literature), Malik Muli\u0107 (Department of Russian Language and Literature) and Bulcsu Laszlo (Department of Comparative Slavistics). The members of the research group from outside the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences were: Bo\u017eidar Finka (Institute for Language of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts), Vladimir Vrani\u0107 (Center for Numerical Research of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts), Vladimir Matkovi\u0107 (Institute for Telecommunications), Vladimir Muljevi\u0107 (Institute for Regulatory and Signal Devices) BIBREF10.",
        "The Russian machine translation pioneer Andreev expressed hope that the Yugoslav (Croatian) research group could create a prototype, but sadly, due to the lack of federal funding, this never happened BIBREF10. Unlike their colleagues in the USA and the USSR, Laszlo\u2019s group had to manage without an actual computer (which is painfully obvious in BIBREF12), and the results remained mainly theoretical. Appealing probably to the political circles of the time, Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that, although it sounds strange, research in computational linguistics is mainly a top-priority military effort in other countries BIBREF11. There is a quote from BIBREF10 which perhaps best delineates the optimism and energy that the researchers in Zagreb had:",
        "In the USSR, there were four major approaches to machine translation in the late 1950s BIBREF7. The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957.

        "In modern times, the idea of machine translation was put forth by the philosopher and logician Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (most notably in BIBREF1 and BIBREF2), whose papers were studied by the Croatian group. Perhaps the most important unrealized point of contact between machine translation and cybernetics happened in the winter of 1950/51. In that period, Bar-Hillel met Rudolf Carnap in Chicago, who introduced to him the (new) idea of cybernetics. Also, Carnap gave him the contact details of his former teaching assistant, Walter Pitts, who was at that moment with Norbert Wiener at MIT and who was supposed to introduce him to Wiener, but the meeting never took place BIBREF3. Nevertheless, Bar-Hillel was to stay at MIT where he, inspired by cybernetics, would go to organize the first machine translation conference in the world in 1952 BIBREF3.",
        "The idea of machine translation was a tempting idea in the 1950s. The main military interest in machine translation as an intelligence gathering tool (translation of scientific papers, daily press, technical reports, and everything the intelligence services could get their hands on) was sparked by the Soviet advance in nuclear technology, and would later be compounded by the success of Vostok 1 (termed by the USA as a \u201cstrategic surprise\u201d). In the nuclear age, being able to read and understand what the other side was working on was of crucial importance BIBREF4. Machine translation was quickly absorbed in the program of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956 (where Artificial Intelligence as a field was born), as one of the five core fields of artificial intelligence (later to be known as natural language processing). One other field was included here, the \u201cnerve nets\u201d as they were known back then, today commonly known as artificial neural networks. What is also essential for our discussion is that the earliest programming language for artificial intelligence, Lisp, was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy BIBREF5. But let us take a closer look at the history of machine translation. In the USA, the first major wave of government and military funding for machine translation came in 1954, and the period of abundancy lasted until 1964, when the National Research Council established the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC), which was to assess the results of the ten years of intense funding. The findings were very negative, and funding was almost gone BIBREF4, hence the ALPAC report became the catalyst for the first \u201cAI Winter\u201d."

Since SARI depends on the differences between a system's output and the input sentence, large differences may yield very good SARI even though the output is ungrammatical.

We analyze the propaganda material they publish in their online English magazine called Dabiq, and use data-mining techniques to computationally uncover contextual text and psychological properties associated with these groups. From our analysis of these texts, we are able to extract a set of signals that provide some insight into the mindset of the radical group.

This system can aid law enforcement and OSN companies to better address such threats and help solve a challenging real-world problem. In future work, we aim to investigate if the model is resilient to different evasion techniques that users may adopt. We will also expand the analysis to other languages.",

N-grams and words frequency have been used in the literature to classify similar problems, such as hate-speech and extremist text and have proven successful BIBREF16 . The second method we use is word embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Research in NLP has compared the effectiveness of word embedding methods for encoding semantic meaning and found that semantic relationships between words are best captured by word vectors within word embedding models BIBREF17 . Therefore, we train word2vec model on our propaganda corpus to build the lexical semantic aspects of the text using vector space models. We learn word embeddings using skip-gram word2vec model implemented in the gensim package with vector size of 100 and window size of 5. This word embedding model is used to obtain the vector representation for each word. We aggregate the vectors for each word in the tweet, and concatenate the maximum and average for each word vector dimension, such that any given tweet is represented in 200 dimension sized vector. This approach of aggregating vectors was used successfully in previous research BIBREF18 . Moreover, since ISIS supporters typically advocate for violent behaviour and tend to use offensive curse words, we use dictionaries of violent words and curse words to record the ratio of such words in the tweet. We also count the frequency of words with all capital letters as they are traditionally used to convey yelling behaviour.",

Several psychological properties are unintentionally transmitted when we communicate. Additionally, literature from the fields of terrorism and psychology suggests that terrorists may differ from non-terrorists in their psychological profiles BIBREF19 . A number of studies looked at the motivating factors surrounding terrorism, radicalization, and recruitment tactics, and found that terrorist groups tend to target vulnerable individuals who have feelings of desperation and displaced aggression. In particular research into the recruiting tactics of ISIS groups, it was found that they focus on harnessing the individual's need for significance. They seek out vulnerable people and provide them with constant attention BIBREF20 . Similarly, these groups create a dichotomy and promote the mentality of dividing the world into \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d BIBREF21 . Inspired by previous research, we extract psychological properties from the radical corpus in order to understand the personality, emotions, and the different psychological properties conveyed in these articles.",
        "Radicalization literature also looked at psychological factors involved with adopting such behaviour. Torok BIBREF12 used a grounded theory approach to develop an explanatory model for the radicalization process utilizing concepts of psychiatric power. Their findings show that the process typically starts with the social isolation of individuals. This isolation seems to be self-imposed as individuals tend to spend a long time engaging with radical content. This leads to the concept of homophily, the tendency to interact and associate with similar others. Through constant interaction with like-minded people, an individual gradually strengthens their mindset and progresses to more extreme levels. Similarly, they start to feel as being part of a group with a strong group identity which leads to group polarization. In psychology, group polarization occurs when discussion leads the group to adopt actions that are more extreme than the initial actions of the individual group members BIBREF13 . Moreover, the National Police Service Agency of the Netherlands developed a model to describe the phases a Jihadist may pass through before committing an act of terrorism BIBREF14 . These sequential phases of radicalism include strong links between the person's psychological and emotional state (e.g., social alienation, depression, lack of confidence in authority) and their susceptibility to radicalization."

As for the INLINEFORM0 category, we find that the use of word2vec embedding improves the performance in comparison with using the tf-idf features. Additionally, all bi-grams and tri-grams features did not contribute much to the classification; only uni-grams did. This can be related to the differences in the writing styles when constructing sentences and phrases in articles and in the social media context (especially given the limitation of the number of words allowed by the Twitter platform). Additionally, the violent word ratio, longWords, and allCaps features are among the top contributing features from this category.

For the model without the utterance-table BERT embedding, using the predicted query only gives around 1.5% improvement. As shown in Figure FIGREF33, this is because the editing mechanism is more helpful for turn 4 which is a small fraction of all question examples. For the model with the utterance-table BERT embedding, the query generation accuracy at each turn is significantly improved, thus reducing the error propagation effect. In this case, the editing approach delivers consistent improvements of 7% increase on question matching accuracy and 11% increase on interaction matching accuracy. Figure FIGREF33 also shows that query editing with BERT benefits all turns.",
        "To empirically verify the usefulness of leveraging the previous query, we consider the process of generating the current query by applying copy and insert operations to the previous query. Figure FIGREF18 shows the SQL query length and the number of copy and insert operations at different turns. As the interaction proceeds, the user question becomes more complicated as it requires longer SQL query to answer. However, more query tokens overlap with the previous query, and thus the number of new tokens remains small at the third turn and beyond.",

While being simple, empirical results demonstrate the benefits of our editing mechanism. The approach is more robust to error propagation than copying segments, and its performance increases when the basic text-to-SQL generation quality (without editing) is better.",
        "To exploit the correlation between sequentially generated queries and generalize the system to different domains, in this paper, we study an editing-based approach for cross-domain context-dependent text-to-SQL generation task. We propose query generation by editing the query in the previous turn. To this end, we first encode the previous query as a sequence of tokens, and the decoder computes a switch to change it at the token level. This sequence editing mechanism models token-level changes and is thus robust to error propagation. Furthermore, to capture the user utterance and the complex database schemas in different domains, we use an utterance-table encoder based on BERT to jointly encode the user utterance and column headers with co-attention, and adopt a table-aware decoder to perform SQL generation with attentions over both the user utterance and column headers."

A more complete multi-turn evaluation is typically measured with a Likert scale (usually 1-4 or 1-5) after the conversation takes place.

        "Cross-Domain BLEU vs. Cluster Proximity An interesting observation can be made with respect to the visual analysis of the domain clusters as depicted in Figure FIGREF15: as the Medical cluster (in Yellow), Law cluster (in Purple) and IT cluster (in Red) are close to each other in the embedding space, their cross-domain BLEU scores are also higher. For example, note how in the results for the Medical domain-specific model (first row in Table TABREF28), the BLEU scores on the Law and IT test sets are much higher in comparison to those on the Koran and Subtitles test sets, which clusters are farther away in the visualized embedding space. Similarly, as the Subtitles cluster (Blue) is closer to the Koran cluster (Green), the highest cross-domain BLEU score on the Koran test set is from the Subtitles model. To further quantify this phenomenon, we plot and measure Pearson's correlation between the cosine similarity of the centroids for the English BERT-based dev sentence representations for each domain pair, and the cross-domain BLEU score for this domain pair. This is shown in Figure FIGREF29. We can see the general trend where the closer the domain centroids are (with a similarity of 1 for training and evaluating on the same domain), the higher the cross-domain BLEU is between those domains, resulting in a Pearson's correlation of 0.81 (strong correlation). This suggests that such preliminary visual analysis can be a useful tool for understanding the relationship between diverse datasets, and motivates the use of pre-trained language model representations for domain data selection in MT.",

BIBREF20 argue that this model error is due to the locally normalized maximum likelihood training objective in NMT that underestimates the margin between the correct translation and shorter ones if trained with regularization and finite data. A similar argument was made by BIBREF10 who pointed out the difficulty for a locally normalized model to estimate the \u201cbudget\u201d for all remaining (longer) translations. BIBREF21 demonstrated that NMT models are often poorly calibrated, and that that can cause the length deficiency. BIBREF5 argued that uncertainty caused by noisy training data may play a role.

We provide an alternative DFS algorithm that relies on the monotonic nature of model scores rather than consistency, and that often converges in practice.",

Finally, further benefiting from our ACM, the above fine-grained text-image representations collaborate to enhance the quality.",
        "Given an input image $I$, and a text description ${S}^{\\prime }$ provided by a user, the model aims to generate a manipulated image $I^{\\prime }$ that is semantically aligned with ${S}^{\\prime }$ while preserving text-irrelevant contents existing in $I$. To achieve this, we propose two novel components: (1) a text-image affine combination module (ACM), and (2) a detail correction module (DCM). We elaborate our model as follows.",
        "Also, to further validate the effectiveness of ACM, we conduct an ablation study shown in Fig. FIGREF16 (c). In \u201cOur w/o ACM\", we fully remove ACM in the main module and remove DCM as well. That is the main module without ACM, and we only concatenate original image features with text features at the beginning of the model and do not further provide additional original image features in the middle of the model. This method is used in both state-of-the-art SISGAN BIBREF8 and TAGAN BIBREF9. It can be seen that our model without ACM fails to produce realistic images on both datasets. In contrast, our full model better generates attributes matching the given text, and also reconstructs text-irrelevant contents shown in (g). Table TABREF11 also verifies the effectiveness of our ACM, as the values of IS and MP increase significantly when we implement ACM."

The gold annotations of the ETS stances were computed with MACE, using the annotations of all crowd workers. We have further assessed the quality of the annotations performed by crowd workers by comparing them to expert annotations. Two experts labeled 200 ETSs, reaching the same agreement as the crowd workers, i.e. $\\kappa = 0.7$.

        "Comparing results across languages we observe that scores for English exceed scores for all other languages. At the same time, for almost all models and languages the IAA scores fall under the category of `fair agreement' ( $0.20 < \\kappa < 0.40$ ) indicating that the elicitation task was feasible for crowdworkers. This applies to both evaluations (Tables 5 and 6 ). We observed a similar pattern in the results of Experiment 1 (Table 3 ). We believe there are two reasons for this drop. Firstly, in order to perform cross-linguistic experiments, we translated English categories into other languages. As mentioned in Sections \"Results\" and \"Results\" , such a direct correspondence may not always exist. Consequently, annotators for languages other than English are faced with a noisier (and potentially harder) task. Secondly, while it is straightforward to recruit English native speakers on crowd sourcing platforms, it has proven more challenging for the other languages. We suspect that our effort to recruit native speakers, might not have been entirely fail-safe for languages other that English, and that the language competence of those crowdworkers might have impacted the quality of their judgments.",
        "For both elicitation studies, we obtained 10 responses per task (see Figures 6 and 7 ); participants judged a single concept and its features per task. All participants were required to be native speakers of the language they were evaluating, and we filtered crowdworkers through their location of residence and self-reported native language (using the functionality provided by the crowdsourcing platforms). We additionally included test questions among tasks for which the true answer was known, and discarded the data from participants who failed to achieve high accuracy on these test questions. Overall, we obtained 50 $\\times $ 10 responses for the feature coherence study and 40 $\\times $ 10 responses for feature relevance.",
        "Figures 2 and 21 qualitatively support the claim that BCF learns meaningful features across languages, which are overall coherent and relevant to their associated category. Some interesting cultural differences emerge, for example German is the only language for which a measurement feature type is induced for vegetables (Figure 21 ; de, 4th from left), while for clothing, a fashion industry feature emerges in French (Figure 21 ; fr, 3rd from left). For the same category, a feature type pertaining to colour emerges for all five languages ( 21 , bold margins). In addition, some features in other languages were not straightforwardly translatable into English. For example, the 3rd feature type for vegetables in Chinese (Figure 21 ) includes the word UTF8gbsn \u5206 which refers to the extent to which food is cooked and UTF8gbsn \u70c2 which is the stage when food starts to fall apart after cooking (stewing). In addition, the feature types induced for the Chinese clothing category include two words which both translate to the English word wear, but in Chinese are specific to wearing small items (e.g., jewelery; UTF8gbsn\u6234), and wearing clothes (UTF8gbsn\u7a7f), respectively. Language-specific features are meaningful, and at the same time category-feature associations across languages reflect culture-driven differences.",

        "Even though much empirical research glosses over this observation, there is strong evidence that human conceptual representations are structured (see BIBREF37 for a recent critique and overview of cognitive studies of categorization). Categories mentally represent the complex structure of the environment. They allow to make inferences about concepts or categories that go beyond their perceived similarities capturing abstract and potentially complex properties (for example, the nutritional value of food items, or the emotional benefits of pets). Much research on human categorization is based on laboratory experiments where subjects are presented with artificial stimuli represented by a restricted set of task-relevant features. Observations of natural concepts, however, are often noisy or incomplete so that a notion of systematic relations among features might be more important here than under artificial conditions in the lab BIBREF38 .",
        "Given their prevalent function in human cognition, the acquisition and representation of categories has attracted considerable attention in cognitive science, and numerous theories have emerged BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Empirical studies of category acquisition and representation, have been predominantly based on small-scale laboratory experiments. In a typical experiment, human subjects are presented with small sets of often artificial concepts, such as binary strings BIBREF14 or colored shapes BIBREF15 , with strictly controlled features BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Hypotheses and principles of human categorization are established based on the processes and characteristics of the categorizations produced by the participants. The distribution of subjects participating in such studies is often skewed towards members of cultural and socioeconomic groups which are prevalent in the environment where the research is conducted, and typically consists to a large proportion of western, educated, wealthy and English-speaking participants often sampled from the even more specific population of college students. The demographic and socioeconomic bias has been long recognized, and the question of how this bias might impact conclusions about human cognition in general BIBREF19 and category learning specifically is under active debate BIBREF9 . Although laboratory studies are invaluable for understanding categorization phenomena in a controlled environment, they are also expensive and time-consuming to conduct, and consequently problematic to scale.",

We present a novel knowledge-lean, cognitively motivated Bayesian model which learns categories and their structured features jointly from large natural language text corpora in five diverse languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and German. We approximate the learning environment using large corpora of natural language text. Language has been shown to redundantly encode much of the non-linguistic information in the natural environment BIBREF20 , and to influence the emergence of categories BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . Besides text corpora can cover arbitrarily semantically complex domains, and are available across languages, providing an ideal test environment for studying categorization at scale.",

For example, meta information can be incorporated by first-order logic in Logit-LDA BIBREF21 and score functions in SC-LDA BIBREF22 .

Second, our sentences may be particularly challenging. The grammatical sentences contained both unusual argument orders and semantically odd situations, thus inciting participants to rate them low.

For example, if English and Spanish are used in a country on Twitter but not reflected on the census, this is a false positive. As shown in Figure 6, the web-crawled corpus has very few false positive outside of Russia and eastern Europe. The situation on Twitter is similar: most false positives are in Russia and Eastern Europe, but in Twitter there are also over-predicted languages in the US and Canada, South Africa, France, India, and Australia. This is important because it shows that relying on Twitter alone would indicate that there are more diverse language speaking populations in these countries. As shown in Table 1, Eastern Europe accounts for 2.4% of the world's population but 27.4% of the web corpus; this explains the region's general false positive rate. For Russia, on the other hand, which is not included in Eastern Europe, the false positive rate cannot be explained in reference to general over-representation. In this case, the false positives are other European languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian. More research is needed to distinguish between immigration, tourism, and business as alternate sources of false positive languages appearing in digital data sets.",

This is potentially problematic because majority languages such as English and Spanish (both very common) are used across widely different demographics. In other words, knowing that a population uses English or Spanish gives us relatively little information about that population. A different view of this is shown in Figure 1, with the distribution by percentage of the data for the top 100 languages in each dataset (not necessarily the same languages).

One factor that is disguised in these figures is that many countries have only a few languages, so that a high true positive rate for a country could reflect only one or two languages.

We regard a table as a \u201cregular\u201d table if it contains header, cell and caption, and the number of cells in each row is equal to the number of header cells. In this work, we make a comprehensive study of table retrieval on regular tables, and would like to release benchmark datasets of good quality. It is trivial to implement heuristic rules so as to convert the irregular tables to regular one, so we leave it to the future work.",

We implement a feature-based approach and a neural network based approach, and release a new dataset consisting of web queries and web tables. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two datasets. Results not only verify the effectiveness of our approach, but also present future challenges for content-based table retrieval.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for table retrieval. We introduce WebQueryTable, an open-domain dataset consisting of query-table pairs. We use search logs from a commercial search engine to get a list of queries that could be potentially answered by web tables. Each query in query logs is paired with a list of web pages, ordered by the number of user clicks for the query. We select the tables occurred in the top ranked web page, and ask annotators to label whether a table is relevant to a query or not. In this way, we get 21,113 query-table pairs. In the real scenario of table retrieval, a system is required to find a table from a huge collection of tables. Therefore, in order to enlarge the search space of our dataset, we extract 252,703 web tables from Wikipedia and regard them as searchable tables as well. Data statistics are given in Table 1 .",
        "We further investigate the effects of headers, cells and caption for table retrieval on WebQueryTable. We first use each aspect separately and then increasingly combine different aspects. Results are given in Table 3 . We can find that in general the performance of an aspect in designed features is consistent with its performance in neural networks. Caption is the most effective aspect on WebQueryTable. This is reasonable as we find that majority of the queries are asking about a list of objects, such as \u201cpolish rivers\", \u201cworld top 5 mountains\" and \u201clist of american cruise lines\". These intentions are more likely to be matched in the caption of a table. Combining more aspects could get better results. Using cells, headers and caption simultaneously gets the best results.",

A table $t$ is a set of data elements arranged by vertical columns and horizontal rows. Formally, we define a table as a triple $t=\\lbrace headers,\\ cells,\\ caption\\rbrace $ that consists of three aspects. A table could have multiple $headers$ , each of which indicates the property of a column and could be used to identify a column. A table could have multiple $cells$ , each of which is a unit where a row and a column intersects. A table could have a $caption$ , which is typically an explanatory text about the table. Figure 1 gives an example to illustrate different aspects of a table."

The model can be easily adapted to other query-question matching models. hCNN is a CNN based matching model which is fast enough to work on the industry application. The input of hCNN is a query $q$ and the $i$-th question $b_i$ in the bag. $q$ and $b_i$ are fed into a CNN respectively. A cross-attention matrix $M^i$ is fed into another CNN to get the interaction representation between them. Each element of $M^i$ is defined as $M^i_{a,b}=q_a^\\top \\cdot b_{i,b}$ where $q_a$ is the word embedding of the $a$-th word in query $q$ and $b_{i,b}$ is the embedding of the $b$-th word in $b_i$. Finally, the outputs of CNNs are combined via Equation SECREF3 to get the representation $r_i$, which indicates the matching representation of the query $q$ and the $i$-th question $b_i$ in the bag. For the Q-Q matching task, the $r_i$ is fed into an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to predict the matching score. In our query-bag matching setting, we will aggregate the $\\lbrace r_1, \\dots , r_n\\rbrace $ to predict the query-bag matching score.

The coverage is based on the cross-attention matrix of the query-bag pair which indicates the matching degree of elements between the query and bag. The mutual coverage is performed by stacking the cross-attention matrix along two directions, i.e., query and bag, in the word level respectively. In addition to the mutual coverage, a bag representation in word level is issued to help discover the main points of a bag. The bag representation then provides new matching evidence to the query-bag matching model."

In a black box setting, we do not have knowledge about the internals of the target model or its training data. Previous work by Papernot et al.

In textual domain, even a small perturbation is clearly perceptible and can completely change the semantics of the text. Another challenge for generating adversarial examples relates to identifying salient areas of the text where a perturbation can be applied successfully to fool the target classifier.

The perturbation procedure consists of random selection of words, finding their nearest neighbours, ranking and substitution to maximize the probability of target category. In this method, random word selection in the sequence to substitute were full of uncertainties and might be meaningless for the target label when changed. Since our model focuses on black-box non-targeted attack using an encoder-decoder approach, our work is closely related to the following techniques in the literature: Wong (2017) BIBREF22, Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 and Gao et al. BIBREF24. Wong (2017) BIBREF22 proposed a GAN-inspired method to generate adversarial text examples targeting black-box classifiers. However, this approach was restricted to binary text classifiers. Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 crafted adversarial examples using their proposed Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Networks (SCPNs). They designed this model for generating syntactically adversarial examples without compromising on the quality of the input semantics. The general process is based on the encoder-decoder architecture of SCPN. Gao et al. BIBREF24 implemented an algorithm called DeepWordBug that generates small text perturbations in a black box setting forcing the deep learning model to make mistakes. DeepWordBug used a scoring function to determine important tokens and then applied character-level transformations to those tokens. Though the algorithm successfully generates adversarial examples by introducing character-level attacks, most of the introduced perturbations are constricted to misspellings. The semantics of the text may be irreversibly changed if excessive misspellings are introduced to fool the target classifier. While SCPNs and DeepWordBug primary rely only on paraphrases and character transformations respectively to fool the classifier, our model uses a hybrid word-character encoder-decoder approach to introduce both paraphrases and character-level perturbations as a part of our attack strategy. Our attacks can be a test of how robust the text classification models are to word and character-level perturbations."

The adversarial sequences generated are able to effectively fool the classifiers without changing the semantics of the text. Our contributions are as follows:",
        "Adversarial examples are generally minimal perturbations applied to the input data in an effort to expose the regions of the input space where a trained model performs poorly. Prior works BIBREF0, BIBREF1 have demonstrated the ability of an adversary to evade state-of-the-art classifiers by carefully crafting attack examples which can be even imperceptible to humans. Following such approaches, there has been a number of techniques aimed at generating adversarial examples BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Depending on the degree of access to the target model, an adversary may operate in one of the two different settings: (a) black-box setting, where an adversary doesn't have access to target model's internal architecture or its parameters, (b) white-box setting, where an adversary has access to the target model, its parameters, and input feature representations. In both these settings, the adversary cannot alter the training data or the target model itself. Depending on the purpose of the adversary, adversarial attacks can be categorized as (a) targeted attack and (b) non-targeted attack. In a targeted attack, the output category of a generated example is intentionally controlled to a specific target category with limited change in semantic information. While a non-targeted attack doesn't care about the category of misclassified results.",
        "We fine-tune our model to fool a target classifier by learning a policy that maximizes a specific discrete metric formulated based on the constraints required to generate adversarial examples. In our work, we use the self-critical approach of Rennie et al. BIBREF36 as our policy gradient training algorithm.",
        "Generating adversarial examples to bypass deep learning classification models have been widely studied. In a white-box setting, some of the approaches include gradient-based BIBREF13, BIBREF6, decision function-based BIBREF2 and spatial transformation based perturbation techniquesBIBREF3. In a black-box setting, several attack strategies have been proposed based on the property of transferability BIBREF1. Papernot et al. BIBREF14, BIBREF15 relied on this transferability property where adversarial examples, generated on one classifier, are likely to cause another classifier to make the same mistake, irrespective of their architecture and training dataset. In order to generate adversarial samples, a local substitute model was trained with queries to the target model. Many learning systems allow query accesses to the model. However, there is little work that can leverage query-based access to target models to construct adversarial samples and move beyond transferability. These studies have primarily focused on image-based classifiers and cannot be directly applied to text-based classifiers."

These synonyms are obtained from WordNet BIBREF8 which contains words grouped together on the basis of their meanings. This involves selection of replaceable words (example of non-replaceable words are stopwords, user names, hash tags, etc) from the tweet and the number of words INLINEFORM0 to be replaced. The probability of the number, INLINEFORM1 , is given by a geometric distribution with parameter INLINEFORM2 in which INLINEFORM3 .

We start with the collection of extracted noun phrases and split them using rLDA and ACRP. Then, we apply the procedure recursively until each noun phrase is selected as a topic label. After every rLDA assignment, each inner node only contains the topic label (top phrase), and the rest of the phrases are divided into nodes at the next level using ACRP and rLDA. Hence, we build a topic tree with each node as a topic label (noun phrase), and each topic is composed of its topic labels and the topic labels of the topic's descendants. In the end, we finalize our terminological ontology by linking the extracted relation triplets with the topic labels as subjects.",

Furthermore, ACRP allows hrLDA to create more reasonable topics and to converge faster in Gibbs sampling.",

However, these models are deficient in that they still need human supervision to decide the number of topics, and to pick meaningful topic labels usually from a list of unigrams. Among models not using unigrams, LDA-based Global Similarity Hierarchy Learning (LDA+GSHL) BIBREF13 only extracts a subset of relations: \u201cbroader\" and \u201crelated\" relations.

For instance, words on the first level of the topic tree come from all four domains. This is because the topic path drawing method in existing hLDA-based models takes words in the most important topic of every document and labels them as the main topic of the corpus.

We use precision, recall and F-measure for this ontology evaluation. A true positive case is an ontology rule that can be found in an extracted ontology and the associated ontology of DBpedia. A false positive case is an incorrectly identified ontology rule. A false negative case is a missed ontology rule. Table TABREF61 shows the evaluation results of ontologies extracted from Wikipedia articles pertaining to European Capital Cities (Corpus E), Office Buildings in Chicago (Corpus O) and Birds of the United States (Corpus B) using hrLDA, KB-LDA, phrase_hLDA (tree depth INLINEFORM0 = 3), and LDA+GSHL in contrast to these gold ontologies belonging to DBpedia. The three corpora used in this evaluation were collected from Wikipedia abstracts, the same text source of DBpedia. The seeds of hrLDA and the root concepts of LDA+GSHL are capital, building, and bird. For both KB-LDA and phrase_hLDA we kept the top five tokens in each topic as each node of their topic trees is a distribution/list of phrases. hrLDA achieves the highest precision and F-measure scores in the three experiments compared to the other models. KB-LDA performs better than phrase_hLDA and LDA+GSHL, and phrase_hLDA performs similarly to LDA+GSHL. In general, hrLDA works well especially when the pre-knowledge already exists inside the corpora. Consider the following two statements taken from the corpus on Birds of the United States as an example. In order to use two short documents \u201cThe Acadian flycatcher is a small insect-eating bird.\" and \u201cThe Pacific loon is a medium-sized member of the loon.\" to infer that the Acadian flycatcher and the Pacific loon are both related to topic bird, the pre-knowledge that \u201cthe loon is a species of bird\" is required for hrLDA.

We conjecture that this behaviour is a consequence of using the INLINEFORM8 score in the objective, and, if undesirable, F INLINEFORM9 with INLINEFORM10 can be used instead. For instance, also in Figure FIGREF29 , INLINEFORM11 correctly detects INLINEFORM12 [it] as non-anaphoric and links INLINEFORM13 [We] with INLINEFORM14 [our].",
        "Because the resolvers are evaluated on F INLINEFORM0 score metrics, it should be that INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 perform the best with INLINEFORM3 . Figure FIGREF30 and Table TABREF25 however do not confirm that: INLINEFORM4 should be set with values a little bit larger than 1. There are two hypotheses. First, the statistical difference between the training set and the development set leads to the case that the optimal INLINEFORM5 on one set can be sub-optimal on the other set. Second, in our experiments we fix INLINEFORM6 , meaning that the relaxations might not be close to the true evaluation metrics enough. Our future work, to confirm/reject this, is to use annealing, i.e., gradually decreasing INLINEFORM7 down to (but larger than) 0."

Results are shown in Table TABREF20 . Surprisingly, the MBN features perform relatively poorly compared to the standard MFCC. These results are contradictory to those reported in BIBREF3 . Two factors may explain this discrepancy: the Mboshi5k data being different from the training data of the MBN neural network, the neural network may not generalize well. Another possibility may be that the initialization scheme of the model is not suitable for this type of features. Indeed, Variational Bayesian Inference algorithm converges only to a local optimum of the objective function and is therefore dependent of the initialization. We believe the second explanation is the more likely since, as we shall see shortly, the best results in term of word segmentation and NMI are eventually obtained with the MBN features when the inference is done with the informative prior. Next, we compared the HMM and the SVAE models when trained with an uninformative prior (lines with \"Inf. Prior\" set to \"no\" in Table TABREF23 ). The SVAE significantly improves the NMI and the precision showing that it extracts more consistent units than the HMM model. However, it also degrades the segmentation in terms of recall. We further investigated this behavior by looking at the duration of the units found by both models compared to the true phones (Table TABREF22 ).

Suppose we embed our words into $\\mathbb {R}^d$. The fundamental assumption is that there exists a linear subspace $B \\subset \\mathbb {R}^d$ that contains (most of) the gender bias in the space of word embeddings. (Note that $B$ is a direction when it is a single vector.) We term this assumption the gender subspace hypothesis. Thus, by basic linear algebra, we may decompose any word vector $\\mathbf {v}\\in \\mathbb {R}^d$ as the sum of the projections onto the bias subspace and its complement: $\\mathbf {v}= \\mathbf {v}_{B} + \\mathbf {v}_{\\perp B}$.

A new variant of CDA we propose (the Names Intervention) is the only to successfully mitigate indirect gender bias: following its application, previously biased words are significantly less clustered according to gender, with an average of 49% reduction in cluster purity when clustering the most biased words. We also proposed Counterfactual Data Substitution, which generally performed better than the CDA equivalents, was notably quicker to compute (as Word2Vec is linear in corpus size), and in theory allows for multiple intervention layers without a corpus becoming exponentially large.",

If, on the other hand, only the degree of gender-specificity were considered, we would see frequent names (like James) being paired with far less frequent names (like Sybil), which would distort the overall frequency distribution of names. This might also result in the retention of a gender signal: for instance, swapping a highly frequent male name with a rare female name might simply make the rare female name behave as a new link between masculine contexts (instead of the original male name), as it rarely appears in female contexts.",

A mapping between nicknames (not covered by administrative sources) and formal names could be learned from a corpus for even wider coverage, possibly via the intermediary of coreference chains.

We compute Cohen's $d$ (a measure of the difference in relative similarity of the word sets within each embedding; higher is more biased), and a one-sided $p$-value which indicates whether the bias detected by WEAT within each embedding is significant (the best outcome being that no such bias is detectable).

Suppose that if a few words' speech features are masked, the E2E model has to predict the token based on other signals, such as tokens that have generated or other unmasked speech features. In this way, we might alleviate the over-fitting issue that generating words only considering its corresponding speech features while ignoring other useful features. We believe our model is more effective when the input is noisy, because a model may generate correct tokens without considering previous generated tokens in a noise-free setting but it has to consider other signals when inputs are noisy, which is confirmed in our experiment.",

Inspired by SpecAgument BIBREF3 and BERT BIBREF4, we propose a semantic mask approach to improve the strength of the language modeling power in the attention-based E2E model, which, at the same time, improves the generalization capacity of the model as well. Like SpecAugment, this approach masks out partial of the acoustic features during model training. However, instead of using a random mask as in SpecAugment, our approach masks out the whole patch of the features corresponding to an output token during training, e.g., a word or a word-piece. The motivation is to encourage the model to fill in the missing token (or correct the semantic error) based on the contextual information with less acoustic evidence, and consequently, the model may have a stronger language modeling power and is more robust to acoustic distortions.",
        "We also analyze the performance of different masking strategies, showing in Table TABREF20, where all models are shallow fused with the RNN language model. The SpecAugment provides 30$\\%$ relative gains on test-clean and other datasets. According to the comparison between the second line and the third line, we find that the word masking is more effective on test-other dataset. The last row indicates word mask is complementary to random mask on the time axis."

        "End-to-end (E2E) acoustic models, particularly with the attention-based encoder-decoder framework BIBREF0, have achieved a competitive recognition accuracy in a wide range of speech datasets BIBREF1. This model directly learns the mapping from the input acoustic signals to the output transcriptions without decomposing the problems into several different modules such as lexicon modeling, acoustic modeling and language modeling as in the conventional hybrid architecture. While this kind of E2E approach significantly simplifies the speech recognition pipeline, the weakness is that it is difficult to tune the strength of each component. One particular problem from our observations is that the attention based E2E model tends to make grammatical errors, which indicates that the language modeling power of the model is weak, possibly due to the small amount of training data, or the mismatch between the training and evaluation data. However, due to the jointly model approach in the attention model, it is unclear how to improve the strength of the language modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the previous output tokens in the decoder, or to improve the strength of the acoustic modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the context vector from the encoder.",
        "As far as we know, our model is the best E2E ASR system on the Librispeech testset, which achieves a comparable result with wav2letter Transformer on test-clean dataset and a better result on test-other dataset, even though our model (75M parameters) is much smaller than the wav2letter Transformer (210M parameters). The reason might be that our semantic masking is more suitable on a noisy setting, because the input features are not reliable and the model has to predict the next token relying on previous ones and the whole context of the input. Our model is built upon the code base of ESPnet, and achieves relative $10\\%$ gains due to the better architecture and masking strategy. Comparing with hybrid methods, our model obtains a similar performance on the test-clean set, but is still worse than the best hybrid model on the test-other dataset.",

The hyper-parameters in Transformer and SpecAugment follow BIBREF6 for a fair comparison. We use Adam algorithm to update the model, and the warmup step is 25000. The learning rate decreases proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number after the 25000-th step. We train our model 100 epochs on 4 P40 GPUs, which approximately costs 5 days to coverage. We also apply speed perturbation by changing the audio speed to 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1. Following BIBREF6, we average the last 5 checkpoints as the final model. Unlike BIBREF14 and BIBREF15, we use the same checkpoint for test-clean and test-other dataset.",
        "In principle, our approach is applicable to the attention-based E2E framework with any type of neural network encoder. To constrain our research scope, we focus on the transformer architecture BIBREF5, which is originally proposed for neural machine translation. Recently, it has been shown that the transformer model can achieve competitive or even higher recognition accuracy compared with the recurrent neural network (RNN) based E2E model for speech recognition BIBREF6. Compared with RNNs, the transformer model can capture the long-term correlations with a computational complexity of $O(1)$, instead of using many steps of back-propagation through time (BPTT) as in RNNs. We evaluate our transformer model with semantic masking on Librispeech and TedLium datasets. We show that semantic masking can achieve significant word error rate reduction (WER) on top of SpecAugment, and we report the lowest WERs on the test sets of the Librispeech corpus with an E2E model.",

Each post was labeled as negative, neutral or positive. There were yet a few samples that revealed both negative and positive sentiments and were marked as bipolar.

The top scores on the two datasets differ a lot. That is because Facebook data classification is a multiclass discrimination problem (negative vs. neutral vs. positive), in contrast with Mall review analysis which is purely binary (negative vs. positive). As we can see, Logistic Regression and SVM are the top performers in Facebook data. NuSVM and Na\u00efve Bayes perform slightly worse. MLP and Random Forest, on the other hand, fall discretely behind. On the Mall dataset, SVM is dominant in both accuracy and F $_1$ . It is followed by Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes and NuSVM. Maximum Entropy is near whereas MLP and Random Forest are again considerably weaker. Similar results are also reported in other works like BIBREF23 where again, SVM and Na\u00efve Bayes outrun Random Forest on text analysis tasks.

It tries to tweak future classifiers based on the wrong predictions of the previous ones and selects only the features known to improve prediction quality. On the negative side, AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers which means that it requires careful data preprocessing. First, we experimented with a few estimators in Adaboost and got poor results in both datasets. Increasing the number of estimators increased accuracy and F $_1$ scores until some point (about 5000 estimators) and was further useless. The detailed results are presented in Table 7 . As we can see, no improvements over the top scores of each algorithm were gained. The results we got are actually slightly lower.

Smileys are essential features in sentiment analysis tasks and should not be lost from the further text cleaning steps. Stanford CoreNLP tokenizer was employed for tokenizing. Numbers, punctuation, and special symbols were removed. At this point, we copied back the smiley patterns to each of the text samples. No stemming or lemmatization was applied."

With the first order gradient descent being the de facto standard in deep learning optimization, the question of the optimal step size or learning rate in each step of the gradient descent arises naturally. The difficulty in choosing a good learning rate can be better understood by considering the two extremes: 1) when the learning rate is too small, training takes a long time; 2) while overly large learning rate causes training to diverge instead of converging to a satisfactory solution.",

The CV range test curve looks more well defined in terms of choosing the max learning rate from the point where the curve starts to be ragged. For NMT, the range curve exhibits a smoother, more plateau characteristic. From Figure FIGREF7, one may be tempted to exploit the plateau characteristic by choosing a larger learning rate on the extreme right end (before divergence occurs) as the triangular policy's max learning rate. From our experiments and empirical observations, this often leads to the loss not converging due to excessive learning rate. It is better to be more conservative and choose the point where the loss stagnates as the max learning rate for the triangular policy.",

In a nutshell, BLEU$n$ measures a modified precision of $n$-grams (e.g. BLEU2 for 2-grams), METEOR measures a harmonic mean-based score of the precision and recall for unigrams, CIDEr measures a weighted cosine similarity of $n$-grams, and ROUGEL is a longest common subsequence-based score.",
        "An audio sample should belong to only one split of data (e.g., training, development, testing). This means that if a word appears only at the captions of one $\\mathbf {x}^{o}$, then this word will be appearing only at one of the splits. Having a word appearing only in training split leads to sub-optimal learning procedure, because resources are spend to words unused in validation and testing. If a word is not appearing in the training split, then the evaluation procedure suffers by having to evaluate on words not known during training. For that reason, for each $\\mathbf {x}^{o}$ we construct the set of words $\\mathbb {S}_{a}^{o}$ from $\\mathbb {C}^{\\prime o}$. Then, we merge all $\\mathbb {S}_{a}^{o}$ to the bag $\\mathbb {S}_{T}$ and we identify all words that appear only once (i.e. having a frequency of one) in $\\mathbb {S}_{T}$. We employ an extra annotator (not from AMT) which has access only to the captions of $\\mathbf {x}^{o}$, and has the instructions to change the all words in $\\mathbb {S}_{T}$ with frequency of one, with other synonym words in $\\mathbb {S}_{T}$ and (if necessary) rephrase the caption. The result is the set of captions $\\mathbb {C}=\\lbrace \\mathbb {C}^{o}\\rbrace _{o=1}^{N}$, with words in $\\mathbb {S}_{T}$ having a frequency of at least two. Each word will appear in the development set and at least in one of the evaluation or testing splits. This process yields the data of the Clotho dataset, $\\mathbb {D}=\\lbrace \\left<\\mathbf {x}^{o}, \\mathbb {C}^{o}\\right>\\rbrace _{o=1}^{N}$."

This works well enough for simple layers, but the interdependencies between the states and the gates inside gated layers like GRUs or LSTMs are complex enough that redundancies cannot be found simply by looking for similar weights. In the spirit of Babaeizadeh et al. sparsify-noiseout, our data-bound version records neuron activities during training to estimate INLINEFORM0 . We compensate for the removal of the INLINEFORM1 -th neuron by using a linear combination of the output of remaining neurons with similar activity patterns. In each layer, we prune 40 neurons each 450 training iterations until the target layer size is reached.

        "Via a detailed multidimensional correlation study we concluded that (a) socioeconomic indicators and linguistic variables are significantly correlated. i.e. people with higher socioeconomic status are more prone to use more standard variants of language and a larger vocabulary set, while people on the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum tend to use more non-standard terms and, on average, a smaller vocabulary set; (b) Spatial position was also found to be a key feature of standard language use as, overall, people from the North tended to use more non-standard terms and a smaller vocabulary set compared to people from the South; a more fine-grained analysis reveals that the spatial variability of language is determined to a greater extent locally by the socioeconomic status; (c) In terms of temporal activity, standard language was more likely to be used during the daytime while non-standard variants were predominant during the night. We explained this temporal variability by the turnover of population with different socioeconomic status active during night and day; Finally (d) we showed that the social network and status homophily mattered in terms of linguistic similarity between peers, as connected users with the same socioeconomic status appeared to be the most similar, while disconnected people were found to be the most dissimilar in terms of their individual use of the aforementioned linguistic markers.",

Not surprisingly, these two curves were strongly correlated as indicated by the high Pearson correlation coefficients summarized in the last column of Table 3 which, again, assured us that our geolocated sample of Twitter users was representative of the whole set of users. At the same time, the temporal variability of these curves suggested that people tweeting during the day used a more standard language than those users who are more active during the night. However, after measuring the average income of active users in a given hour over a week, we obtained an even more sophisticated picture. It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier). This explanation was supported by the high coefficients (summarized in Table 3 ), which were indicative of strong and significant correlations between the temporal variability of average linguistic variables and average income of the active population on Twitter.",

Language variation is not counter adaptive. Rather, subtle differences in the way others speak provide critical cues helping children and adults to organize the social world BIBREF3 . Linguistic variability contributes to the construction of social identity, definition of boundaries between social groups and the production of social norms and hierarchies.",
        "Sociolinguistics has traditionally carried out research on the quantitative analysis of the so-called linguistic variables, i.e. points of the linguistic system which enable speakers to say the same thing in different ways, with these variants being \"identical in reference or truth value, but opposed in their social [...] significance\" BIBREF4 . Such variables have been described in many languages: variable pronunciation of -ing as [in] instead of [i\u014b] in English (playing pronounced playin'); optional realization of the first part of the French negation (je (ne) fume pas, \"I do not smoke\"); optional realization of the plural ending of verb in Brazilian Portuguese (eles disse(ram), \"they said\"). For decades, sociolinguistic studies have showed that hearing certain variants triggers social stereotypes BIBREF5 . The so-called standard variants (e.g. [i\u014b], realization of negative ne and plural -ram) are associated with social prestige, high education, professional ambition and effectiveness. They are more often produced in more formal situation. Non-standard variants are linked to social skills, solidarity and loyalty towards the local group, and they are produced more frequently in less formal situation.",
        "Next we chose to focus on the spatial variation of linguistic variables. Although officially a standard language is used over the whole country, geographic variations of the former may exist due to several reasons BIBREF37 , BIBREF38 . For instance, regional variability resulting from remnants of local languages that have disappeared, uneven spatial distribution of socioeconomic potentials, or influence spreading from neighboring countries might play a part in this process. For the observation of such variability, by using their representative locations, we assigned each user to a department of France. We then computed the $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cn}}$ (resp. $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cp}}$ ) average rates of standard negation (resp. plural agreement) and the $\\overline{L}^{i}_\\mathrm {vs}$ average vocabulary set size for each \"d\u00e9partement\" $i$ in the country (administrative division of France \u2013 There are 97 d\u00e9partements).",
        "Results shown in Fig. 3 a-c revealed some surprising patterns, which appeared to be consistent for each linguistic variable. By considering latitudinal variability it appeared that, overall, people living in the northern part of the country used a less standard language, i.e., negated and pluralized less standardly, and used a smaller number of words. On the other hand, people from the South used a language which is somewhat closer to the standard (in terms of the aforementioned linguistic markers) and a more diverse vocabulary. The most notable exception is Paris, where in the city center people used more standard language, while the contrary is true for the suburbs. This observation, better shown in Fig. 3 a inset, can be explained by the large differences in average socioeconomic status between districts. Such segregation is known to divide the Eastern and Western sides of suburban Paris, and in turn to induce apparent geographic patterns of standard language usage. We found less evident longitudinal dependencies of the observed variables. Although each variable shows a somewhat diagonal trend, the most evident longitudinal dependency appeared for the average rate of standard pluralization (see Fig. 3 b), where users from the Eastern side of the country used the language in less standard ways. Note that we also performed a multivariate regression analysis (not shown here), using the linguistic markers as target and considering as factors both location (in terms of latitude and longitude) as and income as proxy of socioeconomic status. It showed that while location is a strong global determinant of language variability, socioeconomic variability may still be significant locally to determine standard language usage (just as we demonstrated in the case of Paris).",

These results show that correlations between socioeconomic indicators and linguistic variables actually exist. Furthermore, these correlation trends suggest that people with lower SES may use more non-standard expressions (higher rates of incorrect negation and plural forms) have a smaller vocabulary set size than people with higher SES. Note that, although the observed variation of linguistic variables were limited, all the correlations were statistically significant ( $p<10^{-2}$ ) with considerably high $R^2$ values ranging from $0.19$ (between $\\overline{L}_{\\mathrm {cn}}\\sim S_\\mathrm {inc}$ ) to $0.76$ (between $\\overline{L}_{\\mathrm {cp}}\\sim S_\\mathrm {den}$ ). For the rates of standard negation and plural terms the population density appeared to be the most determinant indicator with $R^2=0.74$ (and $0.76$ respectively), while for the vocabulary set size the average income provided the highest correlation (with $R^2=0.7$ )."

It constructs the largest dataset of French tweets enriched with census sociodemographic information existent to date to the best of our knowledge. From this dataset, we observed variation of two grammatical cues and an index of vocabulary size in users located in France. We study how the linguistic cues correlated with three features reflective of the socioeconomic status of the users, their most representative location and their daily periods of activity on Twitter. We also observed whether connected people are more linguistically alike than disconnected ones. Multivariate analysis shows strong correlations between linguistic cues and socioeconomic status as well as a broad spatial pattern never observed before, with more standard language variants and lexical diversity in the southern part of the country. Moreover, we found an unexpected daily cyclic evolution of the frequency of standard variants. Further analysis revealed that the observed cycle arose from the ever changing average economic status of the population of users present in Twitter through the day. Finally, we were able to establish that linguistic similarity between connected people does arises partially but not uniquely due to status homophily (users with similar socioeconomic status are linguistically similar and tend to connect). Its emergence is also due to other effects potentially including other types of homophilic correlations or influence disseminated over links of the social network. Beyond we verify the presence of status homophily in the Twitter social network our results may inform novel methods to infer socioeconomic status of people from the way they use language.

In contrast to orthographic syllables, the BPE units are highly frequent character sequences reflecting the underlying statistical properties of the text. Some of the character sequences discovered by the BPE algorithm may be different linguistic units like syllables, morphemes and affixes. Moreover, BPE can be applied to text in any writing system.",
        "We primarily compare BPE units with orthographic syllables (OS) BIBREF7 , which are good translation units for related languages. The orthographic syllable is a sequence of one or more consonants followed by a vowel, i.e. a C INLINEFORM0 V unit, which approximates a linguistic syllable (e.g. spacious would be segmented as spa ciou s). Orthographic syllabification is rule based and applies to writing systems which represent vowels (alphabets and abugidas).",

In contrast, the gender participation frequency for female workers averaged over all occupations in the BLS report yields a consistently larger figure of INLINEFORM1 .

We ran an one-sided t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the female participation frequency is not significantly greater then the GT female pronoun frequency for the same job positions, obtaining a p-value INLINEFORM4 vastly inferior to our confidence level of INLINEFORM5 and thus rejecting H0 and concluding that Google Translate's female translation frequencies sub-estimates female participation frequencies in US job positions. As a result, it is not possible to understand this asymmetry as a reflection of workplace demographics, and the prominence of male defaults in Google Translate is, we believe, yet lacking a clear justification.",

Although implicit, these biases possibly stem from the real world data which is used to train them, and in this context possibly provide a window into the way our society talks (and writes) about women in the workplace. In this paper, we suggest that and test the hypothesis that statistical translation tools can be probed to yield insights about stereotypical gender roles in our society \u2013 or at least in their training data. By translating professional-related sentences such as \u201cHe/She is an engineer\u201d from gender neutral languages such as Hungarian and Chinese into English, we were able to collect statistics about the asymmetry between female and male pronominal genders in the translation outputs. Our results show that male defaults are not only prominent, but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) occupations. And because Google Translate typically uses English as a lingua franca to translate between other languages (e.g. Chinese INLINEFORM0 English INLINEFORM1 Portuguese) BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 , our findings possibly extend to translations between gender neutral languages and non-gender neutral languages (apart from English) in general, although we have not tested this hypothesis.",

The null hypothesis that neutral pronouns are not significantly more frequent than female ones is accepted with much more frequency, namely for the languages Malay, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Armenian and for the categories Farming & Fishing & Forestry, Healthcare, Legal, Arts & Entertainment, Education. In all three cases, the null hypothesis corresponding to the aggregate for all languages and categories is rejected.

The same is true for the null hypothesis that male pronouns are not significantly more frequent than gender neutral pronouns, with the one exception of the Basque language (which exhibits a rather strong tendency towards neutral pronouns). The null hypothesis that neutral pronouns are not significantly more frequent than female ones is accepted with much more frequency, namely for the languages Malay, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Armenian and for the categories Farming & Fishing & Forestry, Healthcare, Legal, Arts & Entertainment, Education. In all three cases, the null hypothesis corresponding to the aggregate for all languages and categories is rejected.

We ran one-sided t-tests to assess this question for each pair of language and category and also totaled among either languages or categories.

For example, neither male nor female pronouns are significantly more common for Healthcare positions in the Estonian language, but female pronouns are significantly more common for the same category in Finnish and Hungarian. Because of this, Language-Category pairs for which the complementary null hypothesis is rejected are painted in a darker shade of blue (see Table TABREF22 for the three examples cited above."

Using these scores and given a percentage of responses we wish to flag for review, we produce a threshold value in which scores above this threshold level are considered alerts and those below are normal responses. This threshold data was scored using our best engine and the 200 responses that looked most like alerts were sent to be evaluated by our hand-scorers and while only 14 were found to be true alerts. Using the effectiveness of the model used, this suggests between 15 and 17 alerts may be in the entire threshold data set.

        "Given the large collections of unstructured and semi-structured data available on the web, there is a crucial need to enable quick and efficient access to the knowledge content within them. Traditionally, the field of information extraction has focused on extracting such knowledge from unstructured text documents, such as job postings, scientific papers, news articles, and emails. However, the content on the web increasingly contains more varied types of data, including semi-structured web pages, tables that do not adhere to any schema, photographs, videos, and audio. Given a query by a user, the appropriate information may appear in any of these different modes, and thus there's a crucial need for methods to construct knowledge bases from different types of data, and more importantly, combine the evidence in order to extract the correct answer.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to study the problem of attribute extraction from multimodal data. However the problem of attribute extraction from text is well studied. BIBREF1 treat attribute extraction of retail products as a form of named entity recognition. They predefine a list of attributes to extract and train a Na\u00efve Bayes model on a manually labeled seed dataset to extract the corresponding values. BIBREF3 build on this work by bootstrapping to expand the seed list, and evaluate more complicated models such as HMMs, MaxEnt, SVMs, and CRFs. To mitigate the introduction noisy labels when using semi-supervised techniques, BIBREF2 incorporates crowdsourcing to manually accept or reject the newly introduced labels. One major drawback of these approaches is that they require manually labelled seed data to construct the knowledge base of attribute-value pairs, which can be quite expensive for a large number of attributes. BIBREF0 address this problem by using an unsupervised, LDA-based approach to generate word classes from reviews, followed by aligning them to the product description. BIBREF4 propose to extract attribute-value pairs from structured data on product pages, such as HTML tables, and lists, to construct the KB. This is essentially the approach used to construct the knowledge base of attribute-value pairs used in our work, which is automatically performed by Diffbot's Product API.",
        "Motivated by this goal, we introduce the task of multimodal attribute extraction. Provided contextual information about an entity, in the form of any of the modes described above, along with an attribute query, the goal is to extract the corresponding value for that attribute. While attribute extraction on the domain of text has been well-studied BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , to our knowledge this is the first time attribute extraction using a combination of multiple modes of data has been considered. This introduces additional challenges to the problem, since a multimodal attribute extractor needs to be able to return values provided any kind of evidence, whereas modern attribute extractors treat attribute extraction as a tagging problem and thus only work when attributes occur as a substring of text.",

MAE features images, textual descriptions, and attribute-value pairs for a diverse set of products. Preliminary data from an Amazon Mechanical Turk study demonstrates that both modes of information are beneficial to attribute extraction. We measure the performance of a collection of baseline models, and observe that reasonably high accuracy can be obtained using only text. However, we are unable to train off-the-shelf methods to effectively leverage image data."

In contrast, OffPG makes a strong impact by explicitly penalizing the captions with negative feedback: less than 16% captions are identical to the corresponding Baseline captions. Moreover, we observe a large portion of captions with scores of 1.0 in favor of OffPG, indicating that many captions are significantly enhanced. We observe similar trends in all the three metrics.",

In our work, we have observed artifacts of the ratings estimator that negatively impact the performance of this method, e.g., severely ill-formed captions for which the caption estimator had no training signal but assigned high ratings. We report results for this method in Section SECREF4.",
        "There have been multiple attempts to define metrics that evaluate the quality of generated captions. Several studies proposed automatic metrics using ground-truth captions. A few of them are adopted from machine translation community and are based on $n$-gram matches between ground-truth and generated captions; BLEU BIBREF16 and ROUGE BIBREF17 measures precision and recall based on $n$-gram matches, respectively, while METEOR BIBREF18 incorporates alignments between $n$-gram matches. In the context of evaluating image caption quality specifically, CIDEr BIBREF8 and SPICE BIBREF19 utilize more corpus-level and semantic signals to measure matches between generated and ground-truth captions. Aside from these handcrafted metrics, a recent study proposes to learn an automatic metric from a captioning dataset BIBREF1, while another uses semantic similarity between object labels identified in the image and the words in the caption BIBREF20. To overcome the limitations imposed by the automatic metrics, several studies evaluate their models using human judgments BIBREF0, BIBREF2, BIBREF15, BIBREF14. However, none of them utilizes the human-rated captions in the model evaluations. In this work, we show how one can utilize such human-rated captions for training better captioning models.",

The rating estimator extracts the same types of visual features as the captioning model above, and embeds the input caption with a pretrained BERT encoder BIBREF33. We concatenate all these features after projecting into a common embedding space and predict the human ratings of the input image/caption pair. To feed the generated captions from the captioning model directly into the rating estimator, we share the vocabulary (but not the token embeddings) between the two models. We fix the pretrained image feature extraction modules in both models during training, as well as the BERT encoder of the rating estimator. The rating estimator achieves a test performance that is close to the one reported (0.519 Spearman correlation) in BIBREF13; however, as we will discuss further, its performance on the Caption-Quality test set does not transfer well to the needs of the OnPG method, which needs correct rating estimates for ill-formed captions as well."

Section SECREF23 provides more details of the caption ratings dataset that we employ.",

Although a human-ratings dataset is usually just a by-product of human evaluations for past models, such a dataset can be valuable for improving models (as we show in this paper). There are several advantageous properties of a ratings dataset over traditional supervised-learning datasets. First, obtaining ratings for automatically generated outputs is significantly cheaper than collecting ground-truth labels, because it requires less rater training and less time spent annotating. Moreover, if human evaluation is performed anyway during a model's development cycle, there is no additional cost associated to using these annotations for further improving the model. In addition to that, it is easy to capture consensus between multiple raters to reduce noise, e.g., by averaging their scores; it is completely non-trivial to achieve a similar effect from multiple ground-truth labels. Last but not least, the examples with a negative rating score provide valuable training signals, as they explicitly penalize the mistakes that appear in model outputs with high-probability; this type of signal is completely lacking in traditional supervised-learning datasets.",

We measure \u201caverage\u201d goodness score as the average of all the ratings over the test set. We also report a \u201cvoting\u201d score which is the average of the binarized score for each caption based on majority voting. Note that both the \u201caverage\u201d and \u201cvoting\u201d scores are in the range $[0, 1]$, where higher values denote better model performance.",

Convolutions provide a powerful way to extract local context features, analogous to implicitly learning INLINEFORM0 -gram features. We now describe this integral part of our model.",
        "CEQE consists of three major components: (1) embedding layers for words and part-of-speech (POS) tags in both languages, (2) convolution encoding of the local context for each target word, and (3) encoding the global context by the recurrent neural network.",
        "In this paper, we propose a neural architecture, Context Encoding Quality Estimation (CEQE), for better encoding of context in word-level QE. Specifically, we leverage the power of both (1) convolution modules that automatically learn local patterns of surrounding words, and (2) hand-crafted features that allow the model to make more robust predictions in the face of a paucity of labeled data. Moreover, we further utilize stacked recurrent neural networks to capture the long-term dependencies and global context information from the whole sentence."

        "Over the past few years, the problem of recognizing named entities in natural language texts has been addressed by several approaches and frameworks BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . Existing approaches basically adopt look-up strategies and use standard local features, such as part-of-speech tags, previous and next words, substrings, shapes and regex expressions, for instance. The main drawback is the performance of those models with noisy data, such as Tweets. A major reason is that they rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge. In terms of architecture, NER algorithms may also be designed based on generative (e.g., Naive Bayes) or discriminative (e.g., MaxEnt) models. Furthermore, sequence models (HMMs, CMM, MEMM and CRF) are a natural choice to design such systems. A more recent study proposed by Lample et al., 2016 BIBREF9 used neural architectures to solve this problem. Similarly in terms of architecture, Al-Rfou et al., 2015 BIBREF10 had also proposed a model (without dependency) that learns distributed word representations (word embeddings) which encode semantic and syntactic features of words in each language. Chiu and Nichols, 2015 BIBREF11 proposed a neural network architecture that automatically detects word and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN. Thus, these models work without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers. They, however, focused on newswire to improve current state-of-the-art systems and not on the microblogs context, in which they are naturally harder to outperform due to the aforementioned issues. According to Derczynski et al., 2015 BIBREF1 some approaches have been proposed for Twitter, but they are mostly still in development and often not freely available.",

        "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) methods using encoder-decoder schemes are a popular choice for several tasks such as Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Question Answering etc. BIBREF82. However, encoder\u2019s contextual representations are uncertain when dealing with long-range dependencies. To address these drawbacks, Vaswani et al. in BIBREF80 introduced a novel network architecture, called Transformer, relying entirely on self-attention units to map input sequences to output sequences without the use of RNNs. The Transformer\u2019s decoder unit architecture contains a masked multi-head attention layer followed by a multi-head attention unit and a feed forward network whereas the decoder unit is almost identical without the masked attention unit. Multi-head self-attention layers are calculated in parallel facing the computational costs of regular attention layers used by previous seq2seq network architectures. In BIBREF18 the authors presented a model that is founded on findings from various previous studies (e.g., BIBREF83, BIBREF84, BIBREF64, BIBREF49, BIBREF80), which achieved state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, called BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The BERT training process is split in two phases, the unsupervised pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase using labelled data for down-streaming tasks. In contrast with previous proposed models (e.g., BIBREF64, BIBREF49), BERT uses masked language models (MLMs) to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. In the pre-training phase the model is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data from Wikipedia, BookCorpus BIBREF85 and WordPiece BIBREF86 embeddings. In this training part, the model was tested on two tasks; on the first task, the model randomly masks 15% of the input tokens aiming to capture conceptual representations of word sequences by predicting masked words inside the corpus, whereas in the second task the model is given two sentences and tries to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence of the first. In the second phase, BERT is extended with a task-related classifier model that is trained on a supervised manner. During this supervised phase, the pre-trained BERT model receives minimal changes, with the classifier\u2019s parameters trained in order to minimize the loss function. Two models presented in BIBREF18, a \u201cBase Bert\u201d model with 12 encoder layers (i.e. transformer blocks), feed-forward networks with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads, and a \u201cLarge Bert\u201d model with 24 encoder layers 1024 feed-the pre-trained Bert model, an architecture almost identical with the aforementioned Transformer network. A [CLS] token is supplied in the input as the first token, the final hidden state of which is aggregated for classification tasks. Despite the achieved breakthroughs, the BERT model suffers from several drawbacks. Firstly, BERT, as all language models using Transformers, assumes (and pre-supposes) independence between the masked words from the input sequence, and neglects all the positional and dependency information between words. In other words, for the prediction of a masked token both word and position embeddings are masked out, even if positional information is a key-aspect of NLP BIBREF87. In addition, the [MASK] token which, is substituted with masked words, is mostly absent in fine-tuning phase for down-streaming tasks, leading to a pre-training fine-turning discrepancy. To address the cons of BERT, a permutation language model was introduced, so-called XLnet, trained to predict masked tokens in a non-sequential random order, factorizing likelihood in an autoregressive manner without the independence assumption and without relying on any input corruption BIBREF88. In particular, a query stream is used that extends embedding representations to incorporate positional information about the masked words. The original representation set (content stream), including both token and positional embeddings, is then used as input to the query stream following a scheme called \u201cTwo-Stream SelfAttention\u201d. To overcome the problem of slow convergence the authors propose the prediction of the last token in the permutation phase, instead of predicting the entire sequence. Finally, XLnet uses also a special token for the classification and separation of the input sequence, [CLS] and [SEP] respectively, however it also learns an embedding that denotes whether the two words are from the same segment. This is similar to relative positional encodings introduced in TrasformerXL BIBREF87, and extents the ability of XLnet to cope with tasks that encompass arbitrary input segments. Recently, a replication study, BIBREF18, suggested several modifications in the training procedure of BERT which, outperforms the original XLNet architecture on several NLP tasks. The optimized model, called Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), used 10 times more data (160GB compared with the 16GB originally exploited), and is trained with far more epochs than the BERT model (500K vs 100K), using also 8-times larger batch sizes, and a byte-level BPE vocabulary instead of the character-level vocabulary that was previously utilized. Another significant modification, was the dynamic masking technique instead of the single static mask used in BERT. In addition, RoBERTa model removes the next sentence prediction objective used in BERT, following advises by several other studies that question the NSP loss term BIBREF89, BIBREF90, BIBREF91.",
        "The intuition behind our proposed RCNN-RoBERTa approach is founded on the following observation: as pre-trained networks are beneficial for several down-streaming tasks, their outputs could be further enhanced if processed properly by other networks. Towards this end, we devised an end-to-end model with minimum training time that utilizes pre-trained RoBERTa weights combined with a RCNN in order to capture contextual information. Actually, the proposed leaning model is based on a hybrid DL neural architecture that utilizes pre-trained transformer models and feed the hidden representations of the transformer into a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), similar to BIBREF92. In particular, we employed the RoBERTa base model with 12 hidden states and 12 attention heads, and used its output hidden states as an embedding layer to a RCNN. As already stated, contradictions and long-time dependencies within a sentence may be used as strong identifiers of FL expressions. RNNs are often used to capture time relationships between words, however they are strongly biased, i.e. later words are tending to be more dominant that previous ones BIBREF92. This problem can be alleviated with CNNs, which, as unbiased models, can determine semantic relationships between words with max-pooling. Nevertheless, contextual information in CNNs is depended totally on kernel sizes. Thus, we appropriately modified the RCNN model presented in BIBREF92 in order to capture unbiased recurrent informative relationships within text, and we implemented a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layer, which is fed with RoBERTa\u2019s final hidden layer weights. The output of LSTM is concatenated with the embedded weights, and passed through a feedforward network and a max-pooling layer. Finally, softmax function is used for the output layer. Table TABREF12 shows the parameters used in training and Figure FIGREF13 demonstrates our method."

        "ResNet BIBREF8 solves many problems in training very deep CNNs. The key ResNet innovation is the shortcut connections shown in Figure FIGREF1. Figure FIGREF1 is a typical building block of ResNet. The input to the block, $x$, will go through both the original mapping $F(x)$ (weight layers, RELU activations and batch normalization BIBREF3) and the identity shortcut connection. The output, $y$, will be $F(x)+x$. The authors of BIBREF8 hypothesize that the so-called residual mapping of $y=F(x)+x$ should be easier to optimize than the original mapping of $y=F(x)$. The design of the special building block is motivated by the observation in BIBREF6, BIBREF7 that accuracy degrades when more layers are stacked onto an already very deep CNN model. If the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, the deeper model should not have worse training error than the original shallower model without these added layers. The degradation actually suggests that the optimizer has difficulties in approximating identity mappings. With the identity shortcut connections in the ResNet building block, the optimizer can simply drive the layer weights toward zero to make the block identity mapping. ResNet-style CNNs have maintained state-of-the-art results and have inspired other model structures BIBREF9, BIBREF14."

        "Few-shot learning generally resolves the data deficiency problem by recognizing novel classes from very few labeled examples. This limitation in the size of samples (only one or very few examples) challenges the standard fine-tuning method in DL. Early studies in this field BIBREF3 applied data augmentation and regularization techniques to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by data scarcity but only to a limited extent. Instead, researchers have been inspired by human learning to explore meta-learning BIBREF4 to leverage the distribution over similar tasks. Contemporary approaches to few-shot learning often decompose the training procedure into an auxiliary meta-learning phase, which includes many sub-tasks, following the principle that the testing and training conditions must match. They extract some transferable knowledge by switching the task from one mini-batch to the next. Moreover, the few-shot model is able to classify data into new classes with just a small labeled support set.",
        "Few-shot classification is a task in which a classifier must adapt and accommodate new classes that are not seen in training, given only a few examples of each of these new classes. We have a large labeled training set with a set of defined classes INLINEFORM0 . However, after training, our ultimate goal is to produce classifiers on the testing set with a disjoint set of new classes INLINEFORM1 for which only a small labeled support set will be available. If the support set contains INLINEFORM2 labeled examples for each of the INLINEFORM3 unique classes, the target few-shot problem is called a INLINEFORM4 -way INLINEFORM5 -shot problem. Usually, INLINEFORM6 is a too small sample set to train a supervised classification model. Therefore, we aim to perform meta-learning on the training set in order to extract transferrable knowledge that will allow us to perform better few-shot learning on the support set to classify the test set more successfully.",
        "In this study, we attempt to analyze language representation pretraining for few-shot text classification empirically. We combine the MAML algorithm with the pretraining strategy to disentangle the task-agnostic and task-specific representation learning. Results show that our model outperforms conventional state-of-the-art few-shot text classification models. In the future, we plan to apply our method to other NLP scenarios.",
        "It should be noted that human beings are intelligent to leverage learned knowledge about the world in understanding language. BIBREF23 think human beings have a universal grammar, and our daily language system is only a formal expression of this universal grammar. In other words, there are deep structures related to concepts and superficial structures related to speech and symbols in a language. Moreover, neuroscience research has proposed a prominent idea that language processing may offer such a principle that the brain contains partially separate systems for processing syntax and semantics. The part of the prefrontal cortex responsible for language production, called Broca\u2019s area, is thought to be important for parsing syntactic information and applying selective attention to help a separate comprehension system interpret the semantics BIBREF24 . Our idea for few-shot learning in NLP is somewhat similar to this assumption as the pretraining stage may learn common syntax information across tasks, and the meta-learning stage may learn semantic knowledge, which is task specific."

They exist in four different instantiations, i.e., SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK and DESCRIBE. The SELECT query form is the most commonly used and is used to return rows of variable bindings. Therefore, we use this type of query in our explanation. CONSTRUCT allows to create a new RDF graph or modify the existing one through substituting variables in a graph templates for each solution.

This improvement makes sense intuitively, since new Feedback examples are collected based on failure modes of the current model, making them potentially more efficient in a manner similar to new training examples selected via active learning.

If, however, the user seems unsatisfied with its previous response INLINEFORM6 , the agent requests feedback with a question INLINEFORM7 , and the resulting feedback response INLINEFORM8 is used to create a new example for the Feedback task (what feedback am I about to receive?). The agent acknowledges receipt of the feedback and the conversation continues. The rate at which new Dialogue or Feedback examples are collected can be adjusted by raising or lowering the satisfaction threshold INLINEFORM9 (we use INLINEFORM10 ). Periodically, the agent is retrained using all available data, thereby improving performance on the primary Dialogue task.",
        "As shown by Table TABREF22 , even with only 1k training examples (the amount we used for the experiments in Section SECREF18 ), the trained classifier significantly outperforms both the uncertainty-based methods and our original regular expression, by as much as 0.28 and 0.42 F1 points, respectively.",
        "On average, we found that adding 20k Feedback examples benefited the agent about as much as 60k HB Dialogue examples. This is somewhat surprising given the fact that nearly half of the Feedback responses would not even be reasonable responses in a conversation (instead being a list of options, a description of a response, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF9 . Nevertheless, the tasks are related enough that the Dialogue task benefits from the MTL model's improved skill on the Feedback task. And whereas HB Dialogue examples are based on conversations where the user appears to already be satisfied with the agent's responses, each Feedback example corresponds to a mistake made by the model, giving the latter dataset a more active role in improving quality. Interestingly, our best-performing model, which achieves 46.3 accuracy on Dialogue, scores 68.4 on Feedback, suggesting that the auxiliary task is a simpler task overall."

For each predicted token $w_{t}$, where $t$ is the position in the target sentence, we drop its previous token $w_{t-n}$ from the decoder input and watch the performance changes, where $n\\in [1, t]$ is the distance between the dropping token and the current predicted token.

        "That said, the notion of abuse has proven elusive and difficult to formalize. Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks. On the other hand, Waseem and Hovy noted that INLINEFORM1 of all the disagreements in annotation of their dataset occurred on the sexism class. Sexism is typically both generalized and implicit.",

These were determined by cross validation (CV) scores on the provided training data set using cosine similarity as the evaluation metric. We found that using uni-grams and bi-grams performs best and using only bi-grams to be the worst. Using the Unitok tokeniser always performed better than simple whitespace tokenisation. The binary presence of tokens over frequency did not alter performance. The C parameter was tested for three values; 0.01, 0.1 and 1. We found very little difference between 0.1 and 1, but 0.01 produced much poorer results. The eplison parameter was tested for 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 the performance did not differ much but the lower the higher the performance but the more likely to overfit. Using word replacements was effective for all three types (company, positive and negative) but using a value N=10 performed best for both positive and negative words. Using target aspects also improved results. Therefore, the best SVR model comprised of: Unitok tokenisation, uni- and bi- grams, word representation, C=0.1, eplison=0.01, company, positive, and negative word replacements and target aspects.

The shallow discourse parsing is very useful in the text summariza-tion BIBREF0 , opinion analysis BIBREF1 and natural language generation. Shallow discourse parser is the system of parsing raw text into a set of discourse relations between two adjacent or non-adjacent text spans. Discourse relation is composed of a discourse connective, two arguments of the discourse connective and the sense of the discourse connective. Discourse connective signals the explicit dis-course relation, but in non-explicit discourse relation, a discourse connective is omit-ted. Two arguments of the discourse connective, Arg1 and Arg2, which are the two adjacent or non-adjacent text spans connecting in the discourse relation. The sense of the discourse connective characterizes the nature of the discourse relations. The following discourse relation annotation is taken from the document in the PDTB. Arg1 is shown in italicized, and Arg2 is shown in bold. The discourse connective is underlined.",

Only words in the same sentence with the connective are considered for Arg2 candi-dates. Second, we need to choose the best candidate as the head of Arg1 and Arg2.

For Estonian, the operation {insert: m, insert: a} is the most common error. The suffix -ma in Estonian is used to indicate the infinitive form of verbs. Gold lemmata for verbs in Estonian are marked in their infinitive forms whereas our system predicts the stems of these verbs instead. These inflected forms are usually ambiguous and we believe that the model doesn't generalize well to different form-lemma pairs, partly due to fewer training data available for Estonian. This is an example of an error pattern that could be corrected using improved morphological information about the tokens. Finally, in Arabic, we find that the most common error pattern corresponds to a single ambiguous word form, 'an , which can be lemmatized as 'anna (like \u201cthat\u201d in English) or 'an (like \u201cto\u201d in English) depending on the usage of the word in context.

Therefore, we propose different architectures with fixed-size encoder representations.

This modification comes with the price of an information bottleneck due to the process of removing the length variability. On the other hand, it adds additional regularization which would naturally prioritize the features shared between languages.",

We introduce the fixed-size states for the encoder and adds a regularization term to the NMT loss function to encourage similarity between encoder states. The problem with this method is the limiting factor of the fixed-size representations. With the standard architecture, while the length of the encoder states always depends on the source sentence, at each timestep the decoder only has access to a fixed representation of the encoder (context vector from attention). This observation suggests that forcing a decoder state to be independent of the source language and maintaining the variable-size representation for the encoder is possible. In this section, we navigate the target NMT architecture back to the popular variable-length sequential encoder in which no such compromise was made."

Similar to the D-NTMS, the NTM memory module requires a sizeable amount of computational steps to both retrieve a query response from available memory slots, and also to write to a new or existing slot using existing write weights. This must be repeated for each segment. Another source of slowdown with regard to computation is the fact that the intermittent NTM reads and writes force the input utterance into segments, as illustrated in Figure FIGREF2. This splitting of token processing steps requires additional overhead to maintain, and it may discourage parallel computation of different GRU input segments simultaneously. This problem is not theoretical, and may be solved using future optimizations of a chosen deep learning framework. For Pytorch, we observed a slowdown for a segmented dialogue history versus a complete history."

Both pieces of coding software made use of a technique referred to as shallow parsing BIBREF13 . Shallow parsing is best understood in contrast to a deep parsing method. In deep parsing, the entire syntactic structure of a sentence is used and understood. This syntactic structure includes things such as prepositional phrases, direct and indirect objects, and other grammatical structures. A shallow parse, however, focuses solely on, as the name implies, shallow aspects such as the part of speech of the words within the sentence."

Such an approach using two counters was used in proofs in [6], [8] to establish that RNNs with arbitrary precision can emulate Turing machines. We believe that an approach related to this fact could ultimately prove successful, but it would be more useful if set up as in the proofs above in a way that is faithful to the architecture of the neural networks. Counter automata of this sort are also quite unlike the usual implementations found for context-free languages or their extensions for natural languages. Work described in [10] demonstrates that in practice, LSTMs cannot really generalize to recognize the Dyck language INLINEFORM1 .

Multi-channel speech enhancement, such as acoustic BF or source separation, would not only reduce the acoustic variability, it would also result in a reduction of the amount of training data by a factor of $M$, where $M$ is the number of microphones BIBREF4. Previous studies have shown the benefit of training an ASR on matching enhanced speech BIBREF5, BIBREF6 or on jointly training the enhancement and the acoustic model BIBREF7. Alternatively, the training data is often artificially increased by adding even more degraded speech to it. For instance, Ko et al.

BIBREF9 improved the WER of the baseline CHiME-5 system by relative 5.5% by augmenting the training data with approx. 160hrs of simulated reverberated speech.

This is an expected result since BFIt is not a source separation algorithm. Conversely, as the amount of speaker overlap increases, the accuracy gain (relative to None) of the stronger GSS enhancement improves quite significantly. A rather small decrease in accuracy is observed in the mismatched case (Fig. FIGREF25) for GSS1 in the lower overlap regions. As already mentioned in Section SECREF3, this is due to the masking stage. It has previously been observed that using masking for speech enhancement without a cross talker decreases ASR recognition performance. We have also included in Fig. FIGREF25 the GSS1 version without masking (GSS w/o Mask), which indeed yields significant accuracy gains on segments with little overlap. However, since the overall accuracy of GSS1 with masking is higher than the overall gain of GSS1 without masking, GSS w/o mask was not included in the previous experiments."

        "Depending on the number of available arrays for CHiME-5, two flavours of GSS enhancement were used in this work. In the single array track, all 4 channels of the array are used as input ($M = 4$), and the system is referred to as GSS1. In the multi array track, all six arrays are stacked to form a 24 channels super-array ($M = 24$), and this system is denoted as GSS6. The baseline time synchronization provided by the challenge organizers was sufficient to align the data for GSS6.",
        "Using a single acoustic model trained with 308hrs of training data, which resulted after applying multi-array GSS data cleaning and a three-fold speed perturbation, we achieved a WER of 41.6% on the development (DEV) and 43.2% on the evaluation (EVAL) test set of CHiME-5, if the test data is also enhanced with multi-array GSS. This compares very favorably with the recently published top-line in BIBREF12, where the single-system best result, i.e., the WER without system combination, was 45.1% and 47.3% on DEV and EVAL, respectively, using an augmented training data set of 4500hrs total.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section SECREF2 describes the CHiME-5 corpus, Section SECREF3 briefly presents the guided source separation enhancement method, Section SECREF4 shows the ASR experiments and the results, followed by a discussion in Section SECREF5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section SECREF6.",
        "We conjectured that cleaning up the training data would enable a more effective acoustic model training for the CHiME-5 scenario. We have therefore experimented with enhancement algorithms of various strengths, from relatively simple beamforming over single-array GSS to a quite sophisticated multi-array GSS approach, and tested all combinations of training and test data enhancement methods. Furthermore, compared to the initial GSS approach in BIBREF13, we describe here some modifications, which led to improved performance. We also propose an improved neural acoustic modeling structure compared to the CHiME-5 baseline system described in BIBREF9. It consists of initial CNN layers followed by TDNN-F layers, instead of a homogeneous TDNN-F architecture.",
        "Another avenue we have explored for further source separation improvement was to refine the baseline CHiME-5 annotations using ASR output (see fig:enhancementblock). A first-pass decoding using an ASR system is used to predict silence intervals. Then this information is used to adjust the time annotations, which are used in the EM algorithm as described above. When the ASR decoder indicates silence for a speaker, the corresponding class posterior in the MM is forced to zero."

        "Finally, cleaning up the training set not only boosted the recognition performance, but managed to do so using a fraction of the training data in BIBREF12, as shown in Table TABREF15. This translates to significantly faster and cheaper training of acoustic models, which is a major advantage in practice.",
        "In this contribution we advocate for the opposite approach. Although we still believe in the argument that ASR training should see sufficient variability, instead of adding degraded speech to the training data, we clean up the training data. We make, however, sure that the remaining acoustic variability is at least as large as on the test data. By applying a beamformer to the multi-channel input, we even reduce the amount of training data significantly. Consequently, this leads to cheaper and faster acoustic model training.",
        "Based on the distributions in Fig. FIGREF19, the test data was split. Two cases were considered: (a) same enhancement for training and test data (matched case, Table TABREF20), and (b) unprocessed training data and enhanced test data (mismatched case, Table TABREF21). As expected, the WER increases monotonically as the amount of overlap increases in both scenarios, and the recognition accuracy improves as the enhancement method becomes stronger.",
        "However, there has been a long debate whether it is advisable to apply speech enhancement on data used for ASR training, because it is generally agreed upon that the recognizer should be exposed to as much acoustic variability as possible during training, as long as this variability matches the test scenario BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Multi-channel speech enhancement, such as acoustic BF or source separation, would not only reduce the acoustic variability, it would also result in a reduction of the amount of training data by a factor of $M$, where $M$ is the number of microphones BIBREF4. Previous studies have shown the benefit of training an ASR on matching enhanced speech BIBREF5, BIBREF6 or on jointly training the enhancement and the acoustic model BIBREF7. Alternatively, the training data is often artificially increased by adding even more degraded speech to it. For instance, Ko et al. BIBREF8 found that adding simulated reverberated speech improves accuracy significantly on several large vocabulary tasks. Similarly, Manohar et al. BIBREF9 improved the WER of the baseline CHiME-5 system by relative 5.5% by augmenting the training data with approx. 160hrs of simulated reverberated speech. However, not only can the generation of new training data be costly and time consuming, the training process itself is also prolonged if the amount of data is increased.",
        "In Table TABREF12, in each row the recognition accuracy improves monotonically from left to right, i.e., as the enhancement strategy on the test data becomes stronger. Reading the table in each column from top to bottom, one observes that accuracy improves with increasing power of the enhancement on the training data, however, only as long as the enhancement on the training data is not stronger than on the test data. Compared with unprocessed training and test data (None-None), GSS6-GSS6 yields roughly 35% (24%) relative WER reduction on the DEV (EVAL) set, and 12% (11%) relative WER reduction when compared with the None-GSS6 scenario. Comparing the amount of training data used to train the acoustic models, we observe that it decreases drastically from no enhancement to the GSS6 enhancement."

Topic codes were assigned to capture the major subject of the news story. The entire corpus covers thirteen languages, i.e. Dutch, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, written by local reporters in each language. The news stories are not parallel. Single-label stories, i.e. those labeled with only one topic out of the four top categories, are often used for evaluations.

We find that aggregating veridicality in this way provides an accurate signal for predicting outcomes of future contests. Furthermore, TwiVer allows us to perform a number of novel qualitative analyses including retrospective detection of surprise outcomes that were not expected according to popular belief (Section SECREF48 ).

This provides an intuitive measurement of the reliability of an information source (Section SECREF55 ).",

The least polarizing topics include topics related to worker safety (L3) and energy projects (L2). One counter-intuitive observation is topic related to gun control (L4) that is amongst the least polarizing topics.

Indeed, for the NLI tasks, only the LWS setting leads to improvements over the ST models.

This means that, based on the cosine similarity scores - the networks edge weights, the algorithm clusters similar sentences together in a same community while the algorithm proceeds maximizing the connectivity strength amongst the nodes in each community. The network constructed with no threshold in place was detected to have 18 distinct communities with three single node communities.

Using the class maps, we found two notable cases where; 1. the sentences from multiple communities are consist of the sentences of one class of the human labeled data, meaning the original class is splitted into multiple communities and 2. the sentences from one community consist of the sentences of multiple classes in human labeled data, meaning multiple classes in the original data are merged into one community.

        "The Class-split happens when a human labeled class is devided into multiple communities as the sentence network is clustered based on the semantic similarity. This actually can help improve the text classification based systems to work more sophisticatedly as the data set gets more detailed subclasses to design the systems with. Although, it is indeed a helpful phenomena, we would like to minimize the number of subclasses created by the community detection algorithm simply because we want to avoid having too many subclasses that would add more complexity in designing any applications using the community data. On the other hand, the Class-merge happens when multiple human labeled classes are merged into one giant community. This Class-merge phenomena also helps improve the original data set by detecting either misslabeled or ambiguous data entries. We will discuss more details in the following subsection. Nonetheless, we also want to minimize the number of classes merged into the one giant community, because when too many classes are merged into one class, it simply implies that the sentence network is not correctly clustered. For example, as shown in Figure.FIGREF15 red lines, 12 different human labeled classes that do not share any similar intents are merged into COMMUNITY_7. If we trained a text classification model on this data, we would have lost the specifically designed purposes of the 12 different classes, expecting COMMUNITY_7 to deal with all the 12 different types of sentences. This would dramatically degrade the performance of the text classification models.",
        "In order to quantify the degree of Class-split and Class-merge of a network, and to find out optimal connectivity threshold that would yield the sentence network with the best community detection quality, we built two metrics using the class map. We quantified the Class-split by counting the number of communities splitted out from each and every human labeled class, and the Class-merge by counting the number of human labeled classes that are merged into each and every community. We then averaged the Class-splits across all the human labeled classes and Class-merges across all the communities. For example, using the class map of the sentence network with no threshold, we can easily get the number of Class-split and Class-merge as below. By averaging them, we get the Class_split and Class_merge scores of the sentence network, which is 2.7368 and 2.8333 respectively.",
        "Using the Class_merge information we got from the class map, we were able to spot out those sentences that are either misslabeled or ambiguous between classes in the original data set. This is extreamly helpful and convenient feature in fixing and improving text data for classification problems, because data fixing is normally a tedious and time consuming tasks which takes a great amount of human labor. For example, by looking at the class map, in our sentence network with no threshold, COMMUNITY_5 contains sentences appeared in GETINFO_EXACT_ADDRESS and CHAT_AGENT classes. We investigated the sentences in COMMUNITY_5, and were able to spot out one sentence ['I need to address a human being!'] which is very ambiguous for machines to classify between the two classes. This sentence is originally designed for CHAT_AGENT class, but because of its ambiguous expression with the word 'address', it is together with sentences in GETINFO_EXACT_ADDRESS in COMMUNITY_5. After fixing the ambiguity of that sentence by correcting it to ['I need to talk to a human being!'], we easily improved the original data set.",
        "Some previous studies attempted to solve this problem by utilizing unsupervised BIBREF3, BIBREF4 and semisupervised BIBREF5 machine learning models. However, those studies used pre-defined keywords list for each category in the document, which provides the models with extra referencial materials to look at when making the classification predictions, or included already labeled data as a part of the entire data set from which the models learn. In case of using clustering algorithms such as K$-$means BIBREF4, since the features selected for each class depend on the frequency of the particular words in the sentences, when there are words that appear in multiple sentences frequently, it is very much possible that those words can be used as features for multiple classes leading the model to render more ambiguity, and to result a poor performance in classifying documents.",

Second, as its size is comparable with datasets previously released for English NER we expect it to become a reference dataset for the community.",

Importantly, we do not allow the entities to be hierarchical, that is contiguous words belong to an entity as a whole and a single entity type is associated per word.

Since neural nets make mistakes on these examples, introducing them to the network during the training can improve their performance.

Due to the discrete nature of text, it is not feasible to produce perturbed examples from the original inputs.

In the case of $\\epsilon =5.0$ for AE, while it boosts the performance in the restaurant domain for most of the training epochs, it negatively affects the performance in the laptop domain.

Then all the slices of tensor weight derivative are multiplied by the error from their corresponding pre-activated hidden unit values. From these derivations, we are able to see where each slice of tensor weight is learned more directly from their input and hidden layer values compared by using standard addition operations. After we accumulated every parameter's gradients from all the previous time-steps, we use a stochastic gradient optimization method such as AdaGrad BIBREF25 to optimize our model parameters.",

In this experiment, GRURNN made faster progress than LSTMRNN, but eventually LSTMRNN converged into a better BPC based on the development set.

We provide detailed descriptions for each of those conditions in the following sections. For each condition, we analyzed all 40 language pairs for each of our selected models\u2014a total of 480 experiments. In the body of the paper we only present a small representative subset of our results.",
        "From the results of the previous section, it is not clear whether the models perform badly on inflections of generally infrequent lemmata or whether they fail on infrequent morphosyntactic categories, independently of the lexeme frequency. Indeed, the frequency of different morphosyntactic categories is far from uniform. To shed more light on the underlying cause of the performance drop in sec:freqcontrol, we first analyze the differences in the models' performance as they translate forms belonging to different categories and, next, look at the distribution of these categories across the frequency bins.",
        "Another difference lies in the morphological diversity of both dictionaries. The average proportion of paradigm covered for lemmata present in MUSE test dictionaries is 53% for nouns, 37% for adjectives and only 3% for verbs. We generally observe that for most lemmata the dictionaries contain only one inflection. In contrast, for our test dictionaries we get 97% coverage for nouns, 98% for adjectives and 67% for verbs. Note that we do not get 100% coverage as we are limited by the compatibility of source language and target language UniMorph resources.",

In the preceding sections we focused on the standard BLI evaluation, which given our objective is somewhat unfair to the models\u2014they are additionally punished for not capturing lexical semantics. To gain more direct insight into the models' generalization abilities we develop a novel experiment in which the lexeme is controlled for. At test time, the BLI model is given a set of candidate translations, all of which belong to the same paradigm, and is asked to select the most suitable form. Note that the model only requires morphological knowledge to successfully complete the task\u2014no lexical semantics is required. When mapping between closely related languages this task is particularly straightforward, and especially so in the case of fastText where a single $n$-gram, e.g. the suffix -ing in English as in the noun running, can be highly indicative of the inflectional morphology of the word.",
        "The first and most prominent difference lies in the skew towards frequent word forms in MUSE evaluation. While our test dictionaries contain a representative sample of forms in lower frequency bins, the majority of forms present in MUSE are ranked in the top 10k in their respective language vocabularies. This is clearly presented in Figure FIGREF2 for the French\u2013Spanish resource and also holds for the remaining 11 dictionaries."

Table TABREF5 presents an example extract from our resource; every source\u2013target pair is followed by their corresponding lemmata and a shared tag.",

We show that enforcing a simple, hard morphological constraint at training time can lead to performance improvements at test time\u2014both on the standard BLI task and the controlled for lexeme BLI. We adapt the self-learning models of BIBREF4 and BIBREF5 so that at each iteration they can align two words only if they share the same morphosyntactic category. Note that this limits the training data only to word forms present in UniMorph, as those are the only ones for which we have a gold tag. The results, a subset of which we present in Table TABREF35, show that the constraint, despite its simplicity and being trained on less data, leads to performance improvements for every Romance language pair and many of the Slavic language pairs. We take this as evidence that properly modelling morphology will have a role to play in BLI.",
        "Our study is the first to examine morphological generalization in BLI and it reveals a nuanced picture of the interplay between performance, the word's frequency and morphology. We observe that the performance degrades when models are evaluated on less common words\u2014even for the infrequent forms of common lexemes. Our results from the controlled for lexeme experiments suggest that models are able to generalize well for more frequent morphosyntactic categories and for part-of-speech with smaller paradigms. However, their ability to generalize decreases as the slots get less frequent and/or the paradigms get larger. Finally, we proposed a simple method to inject morphological knowledge and demonstrated that making models more morphologically aware can lead to general performance improvements.",
        "Another problem associated with existing resources is `semantic leakage' between train and evaluation sets. As we demonstrate in \u00a7SECREF14, it is common for a single lexeme to appear in both train and test dictionary\u2014in the form of different word inflections. This circumstance is undesirable in evaluation settings as it can lead to performance overstatements\u2014a model can `memorize' the corresponding target lemma, which ultimately reduces the translation task to a much easier task of finding the most appropriate inflection. Finally, most of the available BLI resources include English in each language pair and, given how morphologically impoverished English is, those resources are unsuitable for analysis of morphological generalization.",

To gain more direct insight into the models' generalization abilities we develop a novel experiment in which the lexeme is controlled for. At test time, the BLI model is given a set of candidate translations, all of which belong to the same paradigm, and is asked to select the most suitable form. Note that the model only requires morphological knowledge to successfully complete the task\u2014no lexical semantics is required. When mapping between closely related languages this task is particularly straightforward, and especially so in the case of fastText where a single $n$-gram, e.g. the suffix -ing in English as in the noun running, can be highly indicative of the inflectional morphology of the word."

        "Specifically, section SECREF3 considers context understanding for autonomous vehicles: we describe how a knowledge graph can be built from a dataset of urban driving situations and how this knowledge graph can be translated into a continuous vector-space representation. This embedding space can be used to estimate the semantic similarity of visual scenes by using neural networks as powerful, non-linear function approximators. Here, models may be trained to make danger assessments of the visual scene and, if necessary, transfer control to the human in complex scenarios. The ability to make this assessment is an important capability for autonomous vehicles, when we consider the negative ramifications for a machine to remain invariant to changing weather conditions, anomalous behavior of dynamic obstacles on the road (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians), varied lighting conditions, and other challenging circumstances. We suggest neuro-symbolic fusion as one solution and, indeed, our results show that our embedding space preserves the semantic properties of the conceptual elements that make up visual scenes.",

The first project (section SECREF3) concerned the use of knowledge graphs to learning an embedding space for characterising visual scenes, in the context of autonomous driving.

Although diverse in scope and breadth, both projects adopt a hybrid approach to building AI systems, where deep neural networks are enhanced with knowledge graphs. For instance, in the first project we demonstrated that scenes that are visually different can be discovered as sharing similar semantic characteristics by using knowledge graph embeddings; in the second project we showed that a language model is more accurate when it includes specialized modules to evaluate questions and candidate answers on the basis of a common knowledge graph. In both cases, explainability emerges as a property of the mechanisms that we implemented, through this combination of data-driven algorithms with the relevant knowledge resources.",

        "That the relative frequency of some words changes with city size means that the frequency of words versus their rank, Zipf's law, can vary from metropolitan area to metropolitan area. We obtained that the exponent of Zipf's law depends on city size, namely that the exponent decreases as text size increases. It means that with the growth of a city, rarer words tend to appear in greater numbers. The values obtained for the Zipf exponent are in line with the theoretical bounds 1.6-2.4 of BIBREF54 . In the communication efficiency framework BIBREF54 , BIBREF55 , decreasing INLINEFORM0 can be understood as decreased communication efficiency due to the increased number of different tokens, that requires more effort in the process of understanding from the reader. Using more specific words can also be a result of the 140 character limit, that was the maximum length of a tweet at the time of the data collection, and it may be a similar effect to that of texting BIBREF56 . This suggests that the carrying medium has a huge impact on the exact values of the parameters of linguistic laws.",
        "In our paper, we aim to capture the effect of city size on language use via individual urban scaling laws of words. By examining the so-called scaling exponents, we are able to connect geographical size effects to systematic variations in word use frequencies. We show that the sensitivity of words to population size is also reflected in their meaning. We also investigate how social media language and city size affects the parameters of Zipf's law BIBREF39 , and how the exponent of Zipf's law is different from that of the literature value BIBREF39 , BIBREF40 . We also show that the number of new words needed in longer texts, the Heaps law BIBREF1 exhibits a power-law form on Twitter, indicating a decelerating growth of distinct tokens with city size.",

This type of scaling is usually related to larger cities being disproportionately the centers of innovation and wealth.

In all cases, INLINEFORM0 was greater than 6, which confirmed nonlinear scaling. The the total count of tweets and words both have a slightly superlinear exponents around 1.02. The deviation from the linear exponent may seem small, but in reality it means that for a tenfold increase in city size, the abundance of the quantity INLINEFORM1 measured increases by 5%, which is already a significant change.

        "From the first 5000 words according to word rank by occurrence, the most sublinearly and superlinearly scaling words can be seen in Table TABREF13 . Their exponent differs significantly from that of the total word count, and their meaning can usually be linked to the exponent range qualitatively. The sublinearly scaling words mostly correspond to weather services reporting (flood 0.54, thunderstorm 0.61, wind 0.85), some certain slang and swearword forms (shxt 0.81, dang 0.88, damnit 0.93), outdoor-related activities (fishing 0.82, deer 0.81, truck 0.90, hunting 0.87) and certain companies (walmart 0.83). There is a longer tail in the range of superlinearly scaling words than in the sublinear regime in Figure FIGREF11 . This tail corresponds to Spanish words (gracias 1.41, por 1.40, para 1.39 etc.), that could not be separated from the English text, since the shortness of tweets make automated language detection very noisy. Apart from the Spanish words, again some special slang or swearwords (deadass 1.52, thx 1.16, lmfao 1.17, omfg 1.16), flight-reporting (flight 1.25, delayed 1.24 etc.) and lifestyle-related words (fitness 1.15, fashion 1.15, restaurant 1.14, traffic 1.22) dominate this end of the distribution.",
        "In this paper, we investigated the scaling relations in citywise Twitter corpora coming from the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statstical Areas of the United States. We could observe a slightly superlinear scaling decreasing with the city population for the total volume of the tweets and words created in a city. When observing the scaling of individual words, we found that a certain core vocabulary follows the scaling relationship of that of the bulk text, but most words are sensitive to city size, and their frequencies either increase at a higher or a lower rate with city size than that of the total word volume. At both ends of the spectrum, the meaning of the most superlinearly or most sublinearly scaling words is representative of their exponent. We also examined the increase in the number of words with city size, which has an exponent in the sublinear range. This shows that there is a decreasing amount of new words introduced in larger Twitter corpora.",
        "To assess the validity of the scaling fits for the words, we confirm nonlinear scaling, if the difference between the likelihoods of a model with a INLINEFORM0 (the scaling exponent of the total number of words) and INLINEFORM1 given by the fit is big enough. It means that the difference between the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values of the two models INLINEFORM2 is sufficiently large BIBREF47 : INLINEFORM3 . Otherwise, if INLINEFORM4 , the linear model fits the scaling better, and between the two values, the fit is inconclusive.",
        "For the 11732 words that had at least 10000 occurrences in the dataset, we fitted scaling relationships using the Person Model. The distribution of the fitted exponents is visible in Figure FIGREF11 . There is a most probable exponent of approximately 1.02, which corresponds roughly to the scaling exponent of the overall word count. This is the exponent which we use as an alternative model for deciding nonlinearity, because a word that has a scaling law with the same exponent as the total number of words has the same relative frequency in all urban areas. The linear and inconclusive cases calculated from INLINEFORM0 values are located around this maximum, as shown in different colors in Figure FIGREF11 . In this figure, linearly and nonlinearly classified fits might appear in the same exponent bin, because of the similarity in the fitted exponents, but a difference in the goodness of fit. Words with a smaller exponent, that are \"sublinear\" do not follow the text growth, thus, their relative frequency decreases as city size increases. Words with a greater exponent, that are \"superlinear\" will relatively be more prevalent in texts in bigger cities. There are slightly more words that scale sublinearly (5271, 57% of the nonlinear words) than superlinearly (4011, 43% of the nonlinear words). Three example fits from the three scaling regime are shown in Figure FIGREF10 ."

        "Speech act recognition is a multi-class classification problem. As with any other supervised classification problem, a large labelled dataset is needed. In order to create such a dataset we first created a taxonomy of speech acts for Twitter by identifying and defining a set of commonly occurring speech acts. Next, we manually annotated a large collection of tweets using our taxonomy. Our primary task was to use the expertly annotated dataset to analyse and select various syntactic and semantic features derived from tweets that are predictive of their corresponding speech acts. Using our labelled dataset and robust features we trained standard, off-the-shelf classifiers (such as SVMs, Naive Bayes, etc) for our speech act recognition task.",
        "Twitter-specific Characters: There are certain Twitter-specific characters that can signal speech acts. These characters are #, @, and RT.The position of these characters is also important to consider since Twitter-specific characters used in the initial position of a tweet is more predictive than in other positions. Therefore, we have three additional binary features indicating whether these symbols appear in the initial position."

However, in ReClor, every sentence in the context passages is important, which makes this dataset focus on evaluating the logical reasoning ability of models rather than the ability to extract relevant information from a long context. The length of answer options of ReClor is largest among these datasets. We analyze and manually annotate the types of questions on the testing set and group them into 17 categories, whose percentages and descriptions are shown in Table TABREF11. The percentages of different types of questions reflect those in the logical reasoning module of GMAT and LSAT.

Therefore, it is necessary to find out the biased data points in ReClor in order to evaluate models in a more comprehensive manner BIBREF43. To this end, we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERT$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$, XLNet$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$ and RoBERTa$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. In other words, we purposely remove the context and question in the inputs.

However, the setting of this task is a multiple-choice question with 4 probable options, and even a chance baseline could have 25% probability to get it right. To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set. Then, the data points which are predicted correctly by the models at random could be nearly eliminated, since any data point only has a probability of $(25\\%)^{4}=0.39\\%$ to be guessed right consecutively for four times. Then we unite the sets of data points that are consistently predicted right by each model, because intuitively different models may learn different biases of the dataset.

This phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines.

        "The rule-based TN model can handle the TN task alone and is the baseline in our experiments. It has the same idea as in BIBREF8 but has a more complicated system of rules with priorities. The model contains 45 different groups and about 300 patterns as sub-groups, each of which uses a keyword with regular expressions to match the preceding and following texts. Each pattern also has a priority value. During normalization, each sentence is fed as input and the NSW will be matched by the regular expressions. The model tries to match patterns with longer context and slowly decrease the context length until a match is found. If there are multiple pattern matches with the same length, the one with a higher priority will be chosen for the NSW. The model has been developed on abundant test data and bad cases. The advantage of the rule-based system is the flexibility, since one can simply add more special cases when they appear, such as new units. However, improving the performance of this system on more general cases becomes a bottleneck. For example, in a report of a football game, it cannot transform \u201c1-3\u201d to score if there are no keywords like \u201cscore\u201d or \u201cgame\u201d close to it.",

The surrounding context is the determinant for ambiguous cases in TN. For example, the context will decide whether to read \u201c2019\u201d as year or a number, and whether to read \u201c10:30\u201d as time or the score of a game. In Mandarin, some cases depend on language habit instead of rules- \u201c2\u201d can either be read as \u201cr\u201d or \u201cling\u201d and \u201c1\u201d as \u201cy\u201d or \u201cyo\u201d.",

Then the system performs a priority check on the NSW, and all matched strings will be sent into the rule-based model. The priority patterns include definite NSW such as \u201c911\u201d and other user-defined strings. Then the remaining patterns are passed through the neural model to be classified into one of the pattern groups. Before normalizing the classified NSW in the pattern reader, the format of each classified NSW is checked with regular expressions, and the illegal ones will be filtered back to the rule-based system. For example, classifying \u201c10%\u201d to read as year is illegal. In the pattern reader, each pattern label has a unique process function to perform the NSW-SFW transformation. Finally, all of the normalized SFW are inserted back to the text segmentations to form the output sentences.",

Compared with other modules like LSTM and GRU, self-attention can efficiently extract the information of the NSW with all context in parallel and is fast to train. The core part of the neural model is similar to the encoder of a transformer. The inputs of the model are the sentences with their manually labeled NSW. We take a 30-character context window around each NSW and send it to the embedding layer. Padding is used when the window exceeds the sentence range. After 8 heads of self-attention, the model outputs a vector with dimension of the number of patterns. Finally, the highest masked softmax probability is chosen as the classified pattern group. The mask uses a regular expression to check if the NSW contain symbols and filters illegal ones such as classifying \u201c12:00\u201d as pure number, which is like a bi-class classification before softmax is applied.",

Such words with multiple latent constraints have been a pain-in-the-neck for both semantic parsing and relation extraction, and requires larger training data (this phenomenon is coined as sub-lexical compositionality by wang2015). Most systems are good at triggering the parent constraint, but fail on the other, i.e., the answer entity should be female. Whereas the textual evidence from Wikipedia, ...her mother was Isabella of Barcelos ..., can act as a further constraint to answer the question correctly."

        "After determining the stances of people's reactions, another challenge is how we can utilize public stances to predict rumor veracity accurately. We observe that the temporal dynamics of public stances can indicate rumor veracity. Figure FIGREF2 illustrates the stance distributions of tweets discussing $true$ rumors, $false$ rumors, and $unverified$ rumors, respectively. As we can see, $supporting$ stance dominates the inception phase of spreading. However, as time goes by, the proportion of $denying$ tweets towards $false$ rumors increases quite significantly. Meanwhile, the proportion of $querying$ tweets towards $unverified$ rumors also shows an upward trend. Based on this observation, we propose to model the temporal dynamics of stance evolution with a recurrent neural network (RNN), capturing the crucial signals containing in stance features for effective veracity prediction.",
        "Previous studies have observed that public stances towards rumorous messages are crucial signals to detect trending rumors BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and indicate the veracity of them BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Therefore, stance classification towards rumors is viewed as an important preceding step of rumor veracity prediction, especially in the context of Twitter conversations BIBREF12.",
        "Effect of Stance Features To understand the importance of stance features for veracity prediction, we conduct an ablation study: we only input the content features of all tweets in a conversation to the top component RNN. It means that the RNN only models the temporal variation of tweet contents during spreading, but does not consider their stances and is not \u201cstance-aware\u201d. Table TABREF30 shows that \u201c\u2013 stance features\u201d performs poorly, and thus the temporal modeling process benefits from the indicative signals provided by stance features. Hence, combining the low-level content features and the high-level stance features is crucial to improve rumor veracity prediction.",
        "Especially, our method shows the effectiveness of determining $denying$ stance, while other methods can not give any correct prediction for $denying$ class (the $F_{\\text{D}}$ scores of them are equal to zero). Further, Conversational-GCN also achieves higher $F_1$ score for $querying$ stance ($F_{\\text{Q}}$). Identifying $denying$ and $querying$ stances correctly is crucial for veracity prediction because they play the role of indicators for $false$ and $unverified$ rumors respectively (see Figure FIGREF2). Meanwhile, the class-imbalanced problem of data makes this a challenge. Conversational-GCN effectively encodes structural context for each tweet via aggregating information from its neighbors, learning powerful stance features without feature engineering. It is also more computationally efficient than sequential and temporal based methods. The information aggregations for all tweets in a conversation are worked in parallel and thus the running time is not sensitive to conversation's depth.",
        "Some studies utilized stance labels as the input feature of veracity classifiers to improve the performance BIBREF9, BIBREF38. BIBREF39 proposed to recognize the temporal patterns of true and false rumors' stances by two hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike their solution, our method learns discriminative features of stance evolution with an RNN. Moreover, our method jointly predicts stance and veracity by exploiting both structural and temporal characteristics, whereas HMMs need stance labels as the input sequence of observations."

Given a predefined time frame $T_{\\text{warmup}}$, the learning rate scheduler for the first $T_{\\text{warmup}}$ iterations BIBREF34 is defined as",
        "First, as we can see from the figure, the learning rate warm-up stage is not critical anymore for training the Pre-LN Transformer and the performance of the learned model is competitive. For example, on the IWSLT14 De-En task, the BLEU score and validation loss of the Pre-LN Transformer can achieve around 34 and 4, which are comparable with the performance of the Post-LN Transformer."

        "In this paper, we try to alleviate this problem by finding ways to safely remove the learning rate warm-up stage. As the warm-up stage happens in the first several iterations, we investigate the optimization behavior at initialization using mean field theory BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF15, BIBREF16, BIBREF17. According to our theoretical analysis, when putting the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Therefore, without the warm-up stage, directly using a large learning rate to those parameters can make the optimization process unstable. Using a warm-up stage and training the model with small learning rates practically avoid this problem. Extensive experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.",

For example, one can select a small subset of similar documents by using 28\u201332 bit codes and retrieving documents within small Hamming distance to the query. This will improve retrieval performance, and possibly also precision, at the cost of recall. Conversely, short codes provide a less fine-grained hashing and can be used to index documents within larger Hamming distance to the query. They can therefore be used to improve recall at the cost of retrieval performance, and possibly also precision. For these reasons, we evaluated Real-Binary PV-DBOW models with different code sizes and under different limits on the Hamming distance to the query. In general, we cannot expect these models to achieve 100% recall under the test settings. Furthermore, recall will vary on query-by-query basis.

        "Softmax layers in the models described above should be trained to predict words in documents given binary context vectors. Training should therefore encourage binary activations in the preceding sigmoid layers. This can be done in several ways. In semantic hashing autoencoders BIBREF3 added noise to the sigmoid coding layer. Error backpropagation then countered the noise, by forcing the activations to be close to 0 or 1. Another approach was used by BIBREF12 in autoencoders that learned binary codes for small images. During the forward pass, activations in the coding layer were rounded to 0 or 1. Original (i.e. not rounded) activations were used when backpropagating errors. Alternatively, one could model the document codes with stochastic binary neurons. Learning in this case can still proceed with error backpropagation, provided that a suitable gradient estimator is used alongside stochastic activations. We experimented with the methods used in semantic hashing and Krizhevsky's autoencoders, as well as with the two biased gradient estimators for stochastic binary neurons discussed by BIBREF13 . We also investigated the slope annealing trick BIBREF14 when training networks with stochastic binary activations. From our experience, binary paragraph vector models with rounded activations are easy to train and learn better codes than models with noise-based binarization or stochastic neurons. We therefore use Krizhevsky's binarization in our models."

        "Binary codes have also been applied to cross-modal retrieval where text is one of the modalities. Specifically, BIBREF4 incorporated tag information that often accompany text documents, while BIBREF5 employed siamese neural networks to learn single binary representation for text and image data.",
        "We also compared binary paragraph vectors against codes constructed by first inferring short, real-valued paragraph vectors and then using a separate hashing algorithm for binarization. When the dimensionality of the paragraph vectors is equal to the size of binary codes, the number of network parameters in this approach is similar to that of Binary PV models. We experimented with two standard hashing algorithms, namely random hyperplane projection BIBREF19 and iterative quantization BIBREF20 . Paragraph vectors in these experiments were inferred using PV-DBOW with bigrams. Results reported in Table TABREF9 show no benefit from using a separate algorithm for binarization. On the 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets Binary PV-DBOW yielded higher MAP than the two baseline approaches. On English Wikipedia iterative quantization achieved MAP equal to Binary PV-DBOW, while random hyperplane projection yielded lower MAP. Some gain in precision of top hits can be observed for iterative quantization, as indicated by NDCG@10. However, precision of top hits can also be improved by querying with Real-Binary PV-DBOW model (Section SECREF15 ). It is also worth noting that end-to-end inference in Binary PV models is more convenient than inferring real-valued vectors and then using another algorithm for hashing.",
        "The best codes in our experiments were inferred with Binary PV-DBOW networks. The Binary PV-DM model did not perform so well. BIBREF15 made similar observations for Paragraph Vector models, and argue that in distributed memory model the word context takes a lot of the burden of predicting the central word from the document code. An interesting line of future research could, therefore, focus on models that account for word order, while learning good binary codes. It is also worth noting that BIBREF7 constructed paragraph vectors by combining DM and DBOW representations. This strategy may proof useful also with binary codes, when employed with hashing algorithms designed for longer codes, e.g. with multi-index hashing BIBREF22 .",
        "One of the significant challenges in contemporary information processing is the sheer volume of available data. BIBREF0 , for example, claim that the amount of digital data in the world doubles every two years. This trend underpins efforts to develop algorithms that can efficiently search for relevant information in huge datasets. One class of such algorithms, represented by, e.g., Locality Sensitive Hashing BIBREF1 , relies on hashing data into short, locality-preserving binary codes BIBREF2 . The codes can then be used to group the data into buckets, thereby enabling sublinear search for relevant information, or for fast comparison of data items. Most of the algorithms from this family are data-oblivious, i.e. can generate hashes for any type of data. Nevertheless, some methods target specific kind of input data, like text or image.",
        "Information retrieval results for Real-Binary PV-DBOW are summarized in Table TABREF19 . The model gives higher NDCG@10 than 32-bit Binary PV-DBOW codes (Table TABREF8 ). The difference is large when the initial filtering is restrictive, e.g. when using 28-bit codes and 1-2 bit Hamming distance limit. Real-Binary PV-DBOW can therefore be useful when one needs to quickly find a short list of relevant documents in a large text collection, and the recall level is not of primary importance. If needed, precision can be further improved by using plain Binary PV-DBOW codes for filtering and standard DBOW representation for raking (Table TABREF19 , column B). Note, however, that PV-DBOW model would then use approximately 10 times more parameters than Real-Binary PV-DBOW."

Since the CNN decoder in our model takes a fixed-length sequence as the target, when it comes to decoding sentences, we would need to zero-pad or chop the sentences into a fixed length. As the transferability of the models trained in both cases perform similarly on the evaluation tasks (see rows 1 and 2 in Table TABREF21 ), we focus on the simpler predict-all-words CNN decoder that learns to reconstruct the next window of contiguous words.",

The skip-thoughts model learns to encode the current sentence and decode the surrounding two sentences instead of the input sentence itself, which achieves overall good performance on all tested downstream NLP tasks that cover various topics. The major issue is that the training takes too long since there are two RNN decoders to reconstruct the previous sentence and the next one independently. Intuitively, given the current sentence, inferring the previous sentence and inferring the next one should be different, which supports the usage of two independent decoders in the skip-thoughts model. However, BIBREF6 proposed the skip-thought neighbour model, which only decodes the next sentence based on the current one, and has similar performance on downstream tasks compared to that of their implementation of the skip-thoughts model."

In my opinion, another possible explanation is that a word in word sequence may more statistically depend on the following context than previous one. After all, a number of words are determined by its following words instead of previous ones in some natural languages. Take the articles in English as examples, indefinite article \"an\" is used when the first syllable of next word is a vowel while \"a\" is preposed before words starting with consonant. What's more, if a noun is qualified by an attributive clause, definite article \"the\" should be used before the noun.

What's more, word sequences are commonly taken as signals for LM, and it is easy to take linguistical properties of words or sentences as the features of signals. However, it maybe not a proper way to deal with natural languages. Natural languages are not natural but man-made, and linguistical knowledge are also created by human long after natural language appeared. Liguistical knowledge only covers the \"right\" word sequences in a natural language, but it is common to deal with \"wrong\" ones in real world. In nature, every natural language is a mechanism of linking voices or signs with objects, both concrete and abstract. Therefore, the proper way to deal with natural languages is to find the relations between special voices or signs and objects, and the features of voices or signs can be defined easier than a natural language itself. Every voice or sign can be encoded as a unique code, vector or matrix, according to its features, and the similarities among voices or signs are indeed can be recognized from their codes. It is really difficult to model the relation between voices or signs and objects at once, and this work should be split into several steps. The first step is to covert voice or sign into characters, i.e., speech recognition or image recognition, but it is achieved using the architecture described in Figure FIGREF19 ."

        "Like word classes, caching is also a common used optimization technique in LM. The cache language models are based on the assumption that the word in recent history are more likely to appear again. In cache language model, the conditional probability of a word is calculated by interpolating the output of standard language model and the probability evaluated by caching, like: INLINEFORM0 ",
        "Another type of caching has been proposed as a speed-up technique for RNNLMs BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 . The main idea of this approach is to store the outputs and states of language models for future prediction given the same contextual history. In BIBREF32 , four caches were proposed, and they were all achieved by hash lookup tables to store key and value pairs: probability INLINEFORM0 and word sequence INLINEFORM1 ; history INLINEFORM2 and its corresponding hidden state vector; history INLINEFORM3 and the denominator of the softmax function for classes; history INLINEFORM4 , class index INLINEFORM5 and the denominator of the softmax function for words. In BIBREF32 , around 50-fold speed-up was reported with this caching technique in speech recognition but, unfortunately, it only works for prediction and cannot be applied during training.",
        "where, INLINEFORM0 means Kronecker delta, INLINEFORM1 is the cache length, i.e., the number of previous words taken as cache, INLINEFORM2 is a coefficient depends on INLINEFORM3 which is the distance between previous word and target word. A cache model with forgetting can be obtained by lowering INLINEFORM4 linearly or exponentially respecting to INLINEFORM5 . A class cache model was also proposed by BIBREF28 for the case in which words are clustered into word classes. In class cache model, the probability of target word given the last recent word classes is determined. However, both word based cache model and class one can be defined as a kind of unigram language model built from previous context, and this caching technique is an approach to combine neural network language model with a unigram model.",

        "Inspired by the first caching technique, if the previous context can be taken into account through the internal states of RNN, the perplexity is expected to decrease. In this paper, all language models are trained sentence by sentence, and the initial states of RNN are initialized using a constant vector. This caching technique can be implemented by simply initializing the initial states using the last states of direct previous sentence in the same article. However, the experiment result (Table TABREF15 ) shows this caching technique did not work as excepted and the perplexity even increased slightly. Maybe, the Brown Corpus is too small and more data is needed to evaluated this caching technique, as more context is taken into account with this caching technique."

Each participant posting at least one message during this period is modeled by a vertex in the produced conversational graph. A mobile window is slid over the whole period, one message at a time. At each step, the network is updated either by creating new links, or by updating the weights of existing ones. This sliding window has a fixed length expressed in number of messages, which is derived from ergonomic constraints relative to the online conversation platform studied in Section SECREF5 . It allows focusing on a smaller part of the context period. At a given time, the last message of the window (in blue in Figure FIGREF4 ) is called current message and its author current author. The weight update method assumes that the current message is aimed at the authors of the other messages present in the window, and therefore connects the current author to them (or strengthens their weights if the edge already exists). It also takes chronology into account by favoring the most recent authors in the window. Three different variants of the conversational network are extracted for one given targeted message: the Before network is based on the messages posted before the targeted message, the After network on those posted after, and the Full network on the whole context period.

        "Regarding runtime, the graph-based approach takes more than 8 hours to run for the whole corpus, mainly because of the feature computation step. This is due to the number of features, and to the compute-intensive nature of some of them. The content-based approach is much faster, with a total runtime of less than 1 minute, for the exact opposite reasons. Fusion methods require to compute both content- and graph-based features, so they have the longest runtime."

        "We now want to identify the most discriminative features for all three fusion strategies. We apply an iterative method based on the Sklearn toolkit, which allows us to fit a linear kernel SVM to the dataset and provide a ranking of the input features reflecting their importance in the classification process. Using this ranking, we identify the least discriminant feature, remove it from the dataset, and train a new model with the remaining features.

We call Top Features (TF) the minimal subset of features allowing to reach INLINEFORM1 of the original performance (when considering the complete feature set).",
        "We apply this process to both baselines and all three fusion strategies. We then perform a classification using only their respective TF. The results are presented in Table TABREF10 . Note that the Late Fusion TF performance is obtained using the scores produced by the SVMs trained on Content-based TF and Graph-based TF. These are also used as features when computing the TF for Hybrid Fusion TF (together with the raw content- and graph-based features). In terms of classification performance, by construction, the methods are ranked exactly like when considering all available features.",
        "Next, when comparing the fusion strategies, it appears that Late Fusion performs better than the others, with an INLINEFORM0 -measure of 93.26. This is a little bit surprising: we were expecting to get superior results from the Early Fusion, which has direct access to a much larger number of raw features (488). By comparison, the Late Fusion only gets 2 features, which are themselves the outputs of two other classifiers. This means that the Content-Based and Graph-Based classifiers do a good work in summarizing their inputs, without loosing much of the information necessary to efficiently perform the classification task. Moreover, we assume that the Early Fusion classifier struggles to estimate an appropriate model when dealing with such a large number of features, whereas the Late Fusion one benefits from the pre-processing performed by its two predecessors, which act as if reducing the dimensionality of the data. This seems to be confirmed by the results of the Hybrid Fusion, which produces better results than the Early Fusion, but is still below the Late Fusion. This point could be explored by switching to classification algorithm less sensitive to the number of features. Alternatively, when considering the three SVMs used for the Late Fusion, one could see a simpler form of a very basic Multilayer Perceptron, in which each neuron has been trained separately (without system-wide backpropagation). This could indicate that using a regular Multilayer Perceptron directly on the raw features could lead to improved results, especially if enough training data is available.",
        "Finally, the third fusion strategy can be considered as Hybrid Fusion, as it seeks to combine both previous proposed ones. We create a feature set containing the content- and graph-based features, like with Early Fusion, but also both scores used in Late Fusion. This whole set is used to train a new SVM. The idea is to check whether the scores do not convey certain useful information present in the raw features, in which case combining scores and features should lead to better results.",
        "Besides a better understanding of the dataset and classification process, one interesting use of the TF is that they can allow decreasing the computational cost of the classification. In our case, this is true for all methods: we can retain 97% of the performance while using only a handful of features instead of hundreds. For instance, with the Late Fusion TF, we need only 3% of the total Late Fusion runtime."

        "The Top Features obtained for each method are listed in Table TABREF12 . The last 4 columns precise which variants of the graph-based features are concerned. Indeed, as explained in Section SECREF3 , most of these topological measures can handle/ignore edge weights and/or edge directions, can be vertex- or graph-focused, and can be computed for each of the three types of networks (Before, After and Full).",
        "We now propose a new method seeking to take advantage of both previously described ones. It is based on the assumption that the content- and graph-based features convey different information. Therefore, they could be complementary, and their combination could improve the classification performance. We experiment with three different fusion strategies, which are represented in the right-hand part of Figure FIGREF1 .",
        "We obtain 4 features for Early Fusion TF. One is the Naive Bayes feature (content-based), and the other three are topological measures (graph-based features). Two of the latter correspond to the Corenessof the targeted author, computed for the Before and After graphs. The third topological measure is his/her Eccentricity. This reflects important changes in the interactions around the targeted author. It is likely caused by angry users piling up on the abusive user after he has posted some inflammatory remark. For Hybrid Fusion TF, we also get 4 features, but those include in first place both SVM outputs from the content- and graph-based classifiers. Those are completed by 2 graph-based features, including Strength (also found in the Graph-based and Late Fusion TF) and Coreness (also found in the Graph-based, Early Fusion and Late Fusion TF).",
        "Our first observation is that we get higher INLINEFORM0 -measure values compared to both baselines when performing the fusion, independently from the fusion strategy. This confirms what we expected, i.e. that the information encoded in the interactions between the users differs from the information conveyed by the content of the messages they exchange. Moreover, this shows that both sources are at least partly complementary, since the performance increases when merging them. On a side note, the correlation between the score of the graph- and content-based classifiers is 0.56, which is consistent with these observations.",
        "Once the conversational networks have been extracted, they must be described through numeric values in order to feed the SVM classifier. This is done through a selection of standard topological measures allowing to describe a graph in a number of distinct ways, focusing on different scales and scopes. The scale denotes the nature of the characterized entity. In this work, the individual vertex and the whole graph are considered. When considering a single vertex, the measure focuses on the targeted author (i.e. the author of the targeted message). The scope can be either micro-, meso- or macroscopic: it corresponds to the amount of information considered by the measure. For instance, the graph density is microscopic, the modularity is mesoscopic, and the diameter is macroscopic. All these measures are computed for each graph, and allow describing the conversation surrounding the message of interest. The SVM is then trained using these values as features. In this work, we use exactly the same measures as in BIBREF10 ."

        "The supervision is described under each task, e.g., there are three (conflicting) sources for the Intent task. A task requires labels at the appropriate granularity (singleton, sequence, or set) and type (multiclass or bitvector). The labels are tagged by the source that produced them: these labels may be incomplete and even contradictory. Overton models the sources of these labels, which may come human annotators, or from engineer-defined heuristics such as data augmentation or heuristic labelers. Overton learns the accuracy of these sources using ideas from the Snorkel project BIBREF1. In particular, it estimates the accuracy of these sources and then uses these accuracies to compute a probability that each training point is correct BIBREF9. Overton incorporates this information into the loss function for a task; this also allows Overton to automatically handle common issues like rebalancing classes.",

An engineer defines a slice by tagging a subset of the data and indicating that this tag is also a slice. Engineers typically define slices that consist of a subset that is particular relevant for their job. For example, they may define a slice because it contains related content, e.g., \u201cnutrition-related queries\u201d or because the subset has an interesting product feature, e.g., \u201cqueries with complex disambiguation\u201d. The engineer interacts with Overton by identifying these slices, and providing supervision for examples in those slices. Overton reports the accuracy conditioned on an example being in the slice. The main job of the engineer is to diagnose what kind of supervision would improve a slice, and refine the labels in that slice by correcting labels or adding in new labels.",

Overton compiles the schema into a (parameterized) TensorFlow or PyTorch program, and performs an architecture and hyperparameter search. A benefit of this compilation approach is that Overton can use standard toolkits to monitor training (TensorBoard equivalents) and to meet service-level agreements (Profilers). The models and metadata are written to an S3-like data store that is accessible from the production infrastructure. This has enabled model retraining and deployment to be nearly automatic, allowing teams to ship products more quickly.",

Using standard tools, Overton supports distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, and building servable models. One unanticipated benefit of having both backends was that different resources are often available more conveniently on different platforms. For example, to experiment with pretrained models, the Huggingface repository BIBREF10 allows quick experimentation\u2013but only in PyTorch. The TensorFlow production tools are unmatched. The PyTorch execution mode also allows REPL and in-Jupyter-notebook debugging, which engineers use to repurpose elements, e.g., query similarity features. Even if a team uses a single runtime, different runtime services will inevitably use different versions of that runtime, and Overton insulates the modeling teams from the underlying changes in production serving infrastructure.",

Two years ago, this was a contentious decision as the zeitgeist was that new models were frequently published, and this choice would hamstring the developers. However, as the pace of new model building blocks has slowed, domain engineers no longer feel the need to fine-tune individual components at the level of TensorFlow. Ludwig has taken this approach and garnered adoption. Although developed separately, Overton's schema looks very similar to Ludwig's programs and from conversations with the developers, shared similar motivations. Ludwig, however, focused on the one-off model building process not the management of the model lifecycle. Overton itself only supports text processing, but we are prototyping image, video, and multimodal applications."

Besides the above, a series of post-processing steps are applied to improve the quality of final translations. Our contribution is two-fold:"

In the encoder and decoder, we use a transformer BIBREF3 with four layers and a hidden size of 512. We share all encoder parameters and only share the first decoder layer across two languages to ensure that the latent representation of the source sentence is robust to the source language. We train auto-encoding and back-translation during each iteration. As the training goes on, the importance of language modeling become a less important compared to back-translation.

Specifically, QuaRTz removes the requirement, present in all previous qualitative reasoning work, that a fixed set of qualitative relationships be formally pre-specified.

In particular, when the training data are scarce such as in low-resource language pairs or specific translation domains, NMT models display a modest performance, and other traditional approaches (e.g., PBSMT)BIBREF7 often obtain better accuracies. As such, generalization of NMT systems still calls for significant improvement."

        "As described in Section SECREF13, an unsupervised NMT model contains two decoders to be able to translate into both languages. The model is trained by iterating over two alternate steps: 1) training using the decoders as monolingual, de-noising language models (e.g., en-en, fr-fr), and 2) training using back-translations (e.g., en-fr-en, fr-en-fr). Each step requires an objective function, which is usually an NLL loss. Moreover, each step is performed in both directions (en$\\rightarrow $fr and fr$\\rightarrow $en), which means that an unsupervised NMT model uses a total of four different objective functions. Potentially, the regularizers could be applied to each of them. However, the pre-trained USE sentence embeddings are only available in English, not in French, and for this reason we have limited our experiments to ReWE alone. In addition, the initial results have showed that ReWE is actually detrimental in the de-noising language model step, so we have limited its use to both language directions in the back-translation step, with the hyper-parameter, $\\lambda $, tuned over the validation set ($\\lambda =0.2$).",

The remaining sentence pairs are translations of IT-domain short phrases and Wikipedia titles. Therefore, we consider this dataset as extremely low-resource. It must be said that translations in the IT domain are somehow easier than in the news domain, as this domain is very specific and the wording of the sentences are less varied. For this dataset, we have used the validation and test sets ($1,000$ sentences each) provided in the shared task.",
