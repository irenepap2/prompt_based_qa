In general, as Table TABREF13 shows, our intra-sentence attention RNN was able to outperform the Weka baseline BIBREF5 on the development dataset by a solid margin. Moreover, the model manages to do so without any additional resources, except pre-trained word embeddings. These results are, however, reversed for the test dataset, where our model performs worse than the baseline. This shows that the model is not able to generalize well, which we think is related to the missing semantic information due to the vocabulary gap we observed between the datasets and the GloVe embeddings.",

In particular, given a written essay INLINEFORM0 from a candidate, the goal is to associate the essay with the level INLINEFORM1 of English according to the Common European Framework of Reference for languages (CEFR) system. Under CEFR there are six language levels INLINEFORM2 , such that INLINEFORM3 . In this notation, INLINEFORM4 is the beginner level while INLINEFORM5 is the most advanced level. Notice that the levels of INLINEFORM6 are ordered, thus defining an ordered classification problem. In this sense, care must be taken both during the phase of model selection and during the phase of evaluation. In the latter, predicting a class far from the true should incur a higher penalty. In other words, given a INLINEFORM7 essay, predicting INLINEFORM8 is worse than predicting INLINEFORM9 , and this difference must be captured by the evaluation metrics.",

On the contrary, the classification error is lower (6) when the opposite happens and an INLINEFORM7 essay is classified as INLINEFORM8 .

                "A sentiment analysis can be made at the level of (1) the whole document, (2) the individual sentences, or (what is currently seen as the most attractive approach) (3) at the level of individual fragments of text. Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .",

The 21st century has brought us the rapid development of media, especially in the internet ecosystem. This change has caused the transfer of many areas of our lives to virtual reality. New forms of communication have been established. Their development has created the need for analysis of related data. Nowadays, unstructured information is available in digital form, but how can we analyse and summarise billions of newly created texts that appear daily on the internet? Natural language analysis techniques, statistics and machine learning have emerged as tools to help us. In recent years, particular attention has focused on sentiment analysis. This area is defined as the study of opinions expressed by people as well as attitudes and emotions about a particular topic, product, event, or person. Sentiment analysis determines the polarisation of the text. It answers the question as to whether a particular text is a positive, negative, or neutral one.",

Different formal theories of discourse analysis have been proposed. Martin BIBREF4 proposed discourse relations based on discourse connectives (e.g., because, but) expressed in the text. Danlos BIBREF5 extended sentence grammar and formalize discourse structure. Rhetorical Structure Theory or RST - used in our experiments - was proposed by Mann and Thompson BIBREF6 . The method proposed by them is perhaps the most influential theory of discourse in computational linguistics. Moreover, it was initially intended to be used in text generation tasks, but it became popular for parsing the structure of a text BIBREF7 . Rhetorical Structure Theory represents texts by hierarchical structures with labels. This is a tree structure, which comprises Discourse Trees (DTs). Presented at Figure FIGREF3 this Discourse Tree is a representation of the following text:",
                "The goal of discourse analysis in our method is the segmentation of the text for the basic units of discourse structures EDU (Elementary Discourse Units) and connecting them to determine semantic relations. The analysis is performed separately for each source document, and as the output we get Discourse Trees (DT) such as in Figure FIGREF3 . At this stage, existing discourse parsers will model the structure and the labels of a DT separately. They do not take into account the sequential dependencies between the DT constituents. Then existing discourse parsers will apply greedy and sub-optimal parsing algorithms and build a Discourse Tree. During this stage, and to cope with the mentioned limitation The inferred (posterior) probabilities can be used from CRF parsing models in a probabilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm BIBREF14 which is non-greedy and optimal. Finally, discourse parsers do not discriminate between intra-sentential parsing (i.e., building the DTs for individual sentences) and multi-sentential parsing (i.e., building a DT for the whole document) BIBREF0 . Hence, this part of the analysis will extract for us distributed information about the relationship between different EDUs from parsed texts. Then we assign sentiment orientation to each EDU."

We fitted the importance factor value (on the X axis) so as to enrich final aspects set: a higher factor resulted in a larger aspects set and a higher value of precision metric, with slowly decreasing recall. First results (blue line on charts) were not satisfactory, so we removed a sentiment filtering step of analysis (orange line on chart), which doubled the precision value, with nearly the same value of recall.

Ongoing research on pre-trained code embeddings that don't require a labelled dataset for training is a step in the right direction.

Using this as a `seed' set of controversial articles, we iteratively crawl the `See also', `References' and `External links' hyperlinks up to two hops from the seed list. The negative seed pages (i.e. non controversial) are gathered by using the random article endpoint. The snowball-sample approach includes general, non-Wikipedia, pages that are referred to from Wikipedia pages. The dataset thus extends beyond just the encyclopedia genre of texts. Labels are assumed to propagate: a page linked from a controversial issue is assumed to be controversial. The resulting dataset statistics are summarized in Table TABREF7 .",

In addition, it is easy to control the dimensionality of the bnfs, unlike in the nonparametric models of BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , and this allowed us to use them in the downstream task of word segmentation and clustering. We observed consistent improvements from bnfs across all metrics in this downstream task, and other work demonstrates that these features are also useful for downstream keyword spotting in settings with very small amounts of labeled data BIBREF45 .

An exact implementation of this method is expensive, because, each time a structure change is considered, the MAP parameters of the structure given the data must be re-estimated.

From this corpus we then took a random sample of 25k tweets containing terms from the lexicon and had them manually coded by CrowdFlower (CF) workers.

They were provided with our definition along with a paragraph explaining it in further detail. Users were asked to think not just about the words appearing in a given tweet but about the context in which they were used. They were instructed that the presence of a particular word, however offensive, did not necessarily indicate a tweet is hate speech. Each tweet was coded by three or more people.

This confirms previous observations that readers tend to assign keyphrases in an extractive fashion BIBREF12, which makes these datasets less suitable for the task at hand (keyphrase generation) but rather relevant for a purely extractive task (keyphrase extraction). Yet, author-assigned keyphrases commonly found in scientific paper datasets are not perfect either, as they are less constrained BIBREF13 and include seldom-used variants or misspellings that negatively impact performance. One can see there is an apparent lack of sizeable expert-annotated data that enables the development of neural keyphrase generation models in a domain other than scholarly texts.

We report new state-of-the-art results on WikiPassageQA ($33\\%$ improvement in MAP) and InsuranceQA (version 1.0) ($3.6\\%$ improvement in P@1) by supervised fine-tuning BERT using pairwise rank hinge loss. When evaluated on non-factoid QA datasets, there is a big gap between BERT embeddings and the fully fine-tuned BERT, which suggests that deep interactions between questions and answers are critical to the task. However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected. Similar to BERT for sentence embeddings, mean-pooling and combining the top and bottom layer embeddings lead to better performance, and $(u, v, u * v, |u - v|)$ shows the strongest results among other interaction schemes. Different from sentence-level embeddings, fine-tuning BERT on SNLI doesn't lead to significant improvement, which suggests possible domain mismatch between SNLI and the QA datasets. MLP layer usually provided a 1-2 percent boost in performance compared to the logistic regression layer. For WikiPassageQA, BERT embeddings perform comparably as BM25 baseline.

Fine-tuning on natural language inference datasets improves the quality of sentence embedding, especially on semantic similarity tasks and entailment tasks. Combining embeddings from two layers can further boost the performance on sentence surface and syntactic information probing tasks. Experiments were also conducted by combining embeddings from multiple layers. However, there is no significant and consistent improvement over pooling just from two layers. Adding multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of logistic regression layer on top of the embeddings also provides no significant changes in performance, which suggests that most linguistic properties can be extracted with just a linear readout of the embeddings. Our best model is the combination of embeddings from the top and bottom layer of the BERT fine-tuned on SNLI dataset.",

Instead of focusing on the previously studied game environments BIBREF5, BIBREF6, the dataset considers a more realistic setup: negotiating the price of products listed on Craigslist. The dataset consists of 6682 dialogues between a buyer and a seller who converse in natural language to negotiate the price of a given product (sample in Table TABREF1). In total, 1402 product ad postings were scraped from Craigslist, belonging to six categories: phones, bikes, housing, furniture, car and electronics. Each ad posting contains details such as Product Title, Category Type and a Listing Price. Moreover, a secret target price is also pre-decided for the buyer. The final price after the agreement is called the Agreed Price, which we aim to predict.",

In order to answer these questions, we compare our model empirically with a number of baseline methods. This section presents the methods we compare to, the training setup and the evaluation metrics.",

The predictions were unnormalized before final evaluations. Further, we only considered the negotiations where an agreement was reached. These were the instances for which ground truth was available ($\\sim 75\\%$ of the data). We use a two-layer GRU with a dropout of $0.1$ and 50 hidden units. The models were trained for a maximum of 5000 iterations, with AdamW optimizer BIBREF13, a learning rate of 2x$10^{^-5}$ and a batch size of 4.

Event $e_{i}$ is also a tuple: (Initiator, Type, Data). Initiator is either the Buyer or Seller, Type can be one of (message, offer, accept, reject or quit) and Data consists of either the corresponding natural language dialogue, offer price or can be empty. Nearly $80\\%$ of events in CB dataset are of type `message', each consisting a textual message as Data. An offer is usually made and accepted at the end of each negotiation. Since the offers directly contain the agreed price (which we want to predict), we only consider `message' events in our models. Given the scenario $S$ and first $n$ events $E_n$, our problem is then to learn the function $f_{n}$: $A = f_{n}(S, E_n)$ where $A$ refers to the final agreed price between the two negotiating parties."

For instance, in BIBREF3, the authors computed features related to perturbations of the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the speech signal to classify utterances from 20 PD patients and 20 HC subjects, Turkish speakers. Classifiers based on KNN and SVMs were considered, and accuracies of up to 75% were reported. Later, in BIBREF4 the authors proposed a phonation analysis based on several time frequency representations to assess tremor in the speech of PD patients. The extracted features were based on energy and entropy computed from time frequency representations. Several classifiers were used, including Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and SVMs. Accuracies of up to 77% were reported in utterances of the PC-GITA database BIBREF5, formed with utterances from 50 PD patients and 50 HC subjects, Colombian Spanish native speakers. The authors from BIBREF6 computed features to model different articulation deficits in PD such as vowel quality, coordination of laryngeal and supra-laryngeal activity, precision of consonant articulation, tongue movement, occlusion weakening, and speech timing. The authors studied the rapid repetition of the syllables /pa-ta-ka/ pronounced by 24 Czech native speakers, and reported an accuracy of 88% discriminating between PD patients and HC speakers, using an SVM classifier. Additional articulation features were proposed in BIBREF7, where the authors modeled the difficulty of PD patients to start/stop the vocal fold vibration in continuous speech. The model was based on the energy content in the transitions between unvoiced and voiced segments. The authors classified PD patients and HC speakers with speech recordings in three different languages (Spanish, German, and Czech), and reported accuracies ranging from 80% to 94% depending on the language; however, the results were optimistic, since the hyper-parameters of the classifier were optimized based on the accuracy on the test set. Another articulation model was proposed in BIBREF8. The authors considered a forced alignment strategy to segment the different phonetic units in the speech utterances. The phonemes were segmented and grouped to train different GMMs. The classification was performed based on a threshold of the difference between the posterior probabilities from the models created for HC subjects and PD patients. The model was tested with Colombian Spanish utterances from the PC-GITA database BIBREF5 and with the Czech data from BIBREF9.

The obtained spectrogram is transformed into the Mel-scale using 80 filters, forming an spectrogram with a size of 80$\\times $41, which is used to train the CNNs. The architecture of the implemented CNN is summarized in Table TABREF9. It consists of four convolutional and max-pooling layers, dropout to regularize the weights, and two fully connected layers followed by the output layer to make the final decision using a softmax activation function. The number of feature maps on each convolutional layer is twice the previous one in order to get more detailed representations of the input space in the deeper layers.

Instead, Cross-BiLSTM-CNN, which interleaves every layer of the two directions, models cross-context in an additive manner by learning higher-level representations of the whole context of each token. On the other hand, Att-BiLSTM-CNN models cross-context in a multiplicative manner by capturing the interaction between past and future with a dot-product self-attentive mechanism BIBREF5, BIBREF6.",

The cross-structures bring consistent improvements over the prevalently used Baseline-BiLSTM-CNN without additional gazetteers, POS taggers, language-modeling, or multi-task supervision. The improved core module surpasses comparable previous models on OntoNotes 5.0 and WNUT 2017 by 1.4% and 4.6% respectively.

This paper largely follows their work in constructing the Baseline-BiLSTM-CNN, including the selection of raw features, the CNN, and the multi-layer BiLSTM. A subtle difference is that they send the output of each direction through separate affine-softmax classifiers and then sum their probabilities, while this paper sum the scores from affine layers before computing softmax once.

Namely, we used the dataset provided in \u201cSemantic Evaluation Workshop Task 3\u201d (SemEval-2018) that contains ironic tweets BIBREF95; Riloff\u2019s high quality sarcastic unbalanced dataset BIBREF96; a large dataset containing political comments from Reddit BIBREF97; and a SA dataset that contains tweets with various FL forms from \u201cSemEval-2015 Task 11\u201d BIBREF66. All datasets are used in a binary classification manner (i.e., irony/sarcasm vs. literal), except from the \u201cSemEval-2015 Task 11\u201d dataset where the task is to predict a sentiment integer score (from -5 to 5) for each tweet (refer to BIBREF0 for more details). The evaluation was made across standard five metrics namely, Accuracy (Acc), Precision (Pre), Recall (Rec), F1-score (F1), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). For the SA task the cosine similarity metric (Cos) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are used, as proposed in the original study BIBREF66.",
                "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) methods using encoder-decoder schemes are a popular choice for several tasks such as Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Question Answering etc. BIBREF82. However, encoder\u2019s contextual representations are uncertain when dealing with long-range dependencies. To address these drawbacks, Vaswani et al. in BIBREF80 introduced a novel network architecture, called Transformer, relying entirely on self-attention units to map input sequences to output sequences without the use of RNNs. The Transformer\u2019s decoder unit architecture contains a masked multi-head attention layer followed by a multi-head attention unit and a feed forward network whereas the decoder unit is almost identical without the masked attention unit. Multi-head self-attention layers are calculated in parallel facing the computational costs of regular attention layers used by previous seq2seq network architectures. In BIBREF18 the authors presented a model that is founded on findings from various previous studies (e.g., BIBREF83, BIBREF84, BIBREF64, BIBREF49, BIBREF80), which achieved state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, called BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The BERT training process is split in two phases, the unsupervised pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase using labelled data for down-streaming tasks. In contrast with previous proposed models (e.g., BIBREF64, BIBREF49), BERT uses masked language models (MLMs) to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. In the pre-training phase the model is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data from Wikipedia, BookCorpus BIBREF85 and WordPiece BIBREF86 embeddings. In this training part, the model was tested on two tasks; on the first task, the model randomly masks 15% of the input tokens aiming to capture conceptual representations of word sequences by predicting masked words inside the corpus, whereas in the second task the model is given two sentences and tries to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence of the first. In the second phase, BERT is extended with a task-related classifier model that is trained on a supervised manner. During this supervised phase, the pre-trained BERT model receives minimal changes, with the classifier\u2019s parameters trained in order to minimize the loss function. Two models presented in BIBREF18, a \u201cBase Bert\u201d model with 12 encoder layers (i.e. transformer blocks), feed-forward networks with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads, and a \u201cLarge Bert\u201d model with 24 encoder layers 1024 feed-the pre-trained Bert model, an architecture almost identical with the aforementioned Transformer network. A [CLS] token is supplied in the input as the first token, the final hidden state of which is aggregated for classification tasks. Despite the achieved breakthroughs, the BERT model suffers from several drawbacks. Firstly, BERT, as all language models using Transformers, assumes (and pre-supposes) independence between the masked words from the input sequence, and neglects all the positional and dependency information between words. In other words, for the prediction of a masked token both word and position embeddings are masked out, even if positional information is a key-aspect of NLP BIBREF87. In addition, the [MASK] token which, is substituted with masked words, is mostly absent in fine-tuning phase for down-streaming tasks, leading to a pre-training fine-turning discrepancy. To address the cons of BERT, a permutation language model was introduced, so-called XLnet, trained to predict masked tokens in a non-sequential random order, factorizing likelihood in an autoregressive manner without the independence assumption and without relying on any input corruption BIBREF88. In particular, a query stream is used that extends embedding representations to incorporate positional information about the masked words. The original representation set (content stream), including both token and positional embeddings, is then used as input to the query stream following a scheme called \u201cTwo-Stream SelfAttention\u201d. To overcome the problem of slow convergence the authors propose the prediction of the last token in the permutation phase, instead of predicting the entire sequence. Finally, XLnet uses also a special token for the classification and separation of the input sequence, [CLS] and [SEP] respectively, however it also learns an embedding that denotes whether the two words are from the same segment. This is similar to relative positional encodings introduced in TrasformerXL BIBREF87, and extents the ability of XLnet to cope with tasks that encompass arbitrary input segments. Recently, a replication study, BIBREF18, suggested several modifications in the training procedure of BERT which, outperforms the original XLNet architecture on several NLP tasks. The optimized model, called Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), used 10 times more data (160GB compared with the 16GB originally exploited), and is trained with far more epochs than the BERT model (500K vs 100K), using also 8-times larger batch sizes, and a byte-level BPE vocabulary instead of the character-level vocabulary that was previously utilized. Another significant modification, was the dynamic masking technique instead of the single static mask used in BERT. In addition, RoBERTa model removes the next sentence prediction objective used in BERT, following advises by several other studies that question the NSP loss term BIBREF89, BIBREF90, BIBREF91.",
                "In our experiments we compared our model with several seven different classifiers under different settings. For the ELMo system we used the mean-pooling of all contextualized word representations, i.e. character-based embedding representations and the output of the two layer LSTM resulting with a 1024 dimensional vector, and passed it through two deep dense ReLu activated layers with 256 and 64 units. Similarly, USE embeddings are trained with a Transformer encoder and output 512 dimensional vector for each sample, which is also passed through through two deep dense ReLu activated layers with 256 and 64 units. Both ELMo and USE embeddings retrieved from TensorFlow Hub. NBSVM system was modified according to BIBREF93 and trained with a ${10^{-3}}$ leaning rate for 5 epochs with Adam optimizer BIBREF100. FastText system was implemented by utilizing pre-trained embeddings BIBREF94 passed through a global max-pooling and a 64 unit fully connected layer. System was trained with Adam optimizer with learning rate ${0.1}$ for 3 epochs. XLnet model implemented using the base-cased model with 12 layers, 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads. Model trained with learning rate ${4 \\times 10^{-5}}$ using ${10^{-5}}$ weight decay for 3 epochs. We exploited both cased and uncased BERT-base models containing 12 layers, 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads. We trained models for 3 epochs with learning rate ${2 \\times 10^{-5}}$ using ${10^{-5}}$ weight decay. We trained RoBERTa model following the setting of BERT model. RoBERTa, XLnet and BERT models implemented using pytorch-transformers library .",
                "Pre-trained word embeddings proved to increase classification performances in many NLP tasks. In particular, Global Vectors (GloVe) BIBREF74 and Word2Vec BIBREF75 became popular in various tasks due to their ability to capture representative semantic representations of words, trained on large amount of data. However, in various studies (e.g., BIBREF76, BIBREF64, BIBREF77) it is argued that the actual meaning of words along with their semantics representations varies according to their context. Following this assumption, researchers in BIBREF64 present an approach that is based on the creation of pre-trained word embeddings through building a bidirectional Language model, i.e. predicting next word within a sequence. The ELMo model was exhaustingly trained on 30 million sentences corpus BIBREF78, with a two layered bidirectional LSTM architecture, aiming to predict both next and previous words, introducing the concept of contextual embeddings. The final embeddings vector is produced by a task specific weighted sum of the two directional hidden layers of LSTM models. Another contextual approach for creating embedding vector representations is proposed in BIBREF79 where, complete sentences, instead of words, are mapped to a latent vector space. The approach provides two variations of Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) with some trade-offs in computation and accuracy. The first approach consists of a computationally intensive transformer that resembles a transformer network BIBREF80, proved to achieve higher performance figures. In contrast, the second approach provides a light-weight model that averages input embedding weights for words and bi-grams by utilizing of a Deep Average Network (DAN) BIBREF81. The output of the DAN is passed through a feedforward neural network in order to produce the sentence embeddings. Both approaches take as input lowercased PTB tokenized strings, and output a 512-dimensional sentence embedding vectors."

While for laptop there are similar improvements in both tasks (+0.69 in AE, +0.61 in ASC), for restaurant we observe different enhancements (+0.81 in AE, +0.12 in ASC).
