Today the date is {{current_dt}}. Given the following query, generate a "Search" and "Extract" query in natural language. For queries that require "Filter" queries choose form list: [{"location_countries"}, {"organizations"}, {"date[lower_bound]"}, {"date[upper_bound]"}]. For queries that refer to "last year", "past year", "last 4 months" etc. keep in mind that today the date is {{current_dt}}.
