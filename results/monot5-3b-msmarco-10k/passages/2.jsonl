On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.", "In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset.

All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold)."]}

Although word embeddings have been shown to provide benefit to such models, they commonly treat words as the smallest meaning bearing unit and assume that each word type has its own vector representation. This assumption has two major shortcomings especially for languages with rich morphology: (1) inability to handle unseen or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word-forms (2) inability to exploit the regularities among word parts. The limitations of word embeddings are particularly pronounced in sentence-level semantic tasks, especially in languages where word parts play a crucial role. Consider the Turkish sentences \u201cK\u00f6y+l\u00fc-ler (villagers) \u015fehr+e (to town) geldi (came)\u201d and \u201cSendika+l\u0131-lar (union members) meclis+e (to council) geldi (came)\u201d.

These semantic similarities are determined by the common word parts shown in bold. However ortographic similarity does not always correspond to semantic similarity. For instance the ortographically similar words knight and night have large semantic differences. Therefore, for a successful semantic application, the model should be able to capture both the regularities, i.e, morphological tags and the irregularities, i.e, lemmas of the word."]}

By using embeddings, neural architectures are also able to leverage features learned on other texts (e.g. pretrained word embeddings) and create higher level representations of input (e.g. convolutional feature maps or hidden-states). These properties suggest that neural approaches are better able to generalize to unseen examples that poorly match the training set.

Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works.

We also found that a network trained on the combined dataset generated fewer offensive jokes compared to the one trained on just the jokes (as the jokes scraped from the internet were offensive with high probability). This is the first time anyone has used controlled LSTM architecture to generate texts with different sentiments. We show how the network learns to introduce incongruities in the generated text (making it funny) when asked to generate a joke as opposed to a quote (which is inspirational).With the current resurgence of deep-neural networks and its astounding success in natural language generation, our paper tries to achieve the above goal."]}

Thus, each capsule can encode many characteristics in the embedding triple to represent the entries at the corresponding dimension.

In Chinese, a particular sequence of strokes can reflect the inherent semantics. As shown in the upper half of Figure FIGREF3 , the Chinese character \u201c\u9a7e\" (drive) can be decomposed into a sequence of eight strokes, where the last three strokes together correspond to a root character \u201c\u9a6c\" (horse) similar to the root \u201cclar\" of English word \u201cdeclare\" and \u201cclarify\".", "Moreover, Chinese is a language originated from Oracle Bone Inscriptions (a kind of hieroglyphics).

Preliminary qualitative results show that MagiCoder drastically reduces the amount of work required for the revision of a report, allowing the pharmacovigilance stakeholders to provide high quality data about suspected ADRs.", "Online reports have grown up to become the 30% of the total number of Italian reports. As expected, it has been possible to observe that the average time between the dispatch of online reports and the insertion into RNF is sensibly shorter with respect to the insertion from printed reports. Notwithstanding, there is an operation which still requires the manual intervention of responsibles for pharmacovigilance also for online report revisions: the encoding in MedDRA terminology of the free text, through which the reporter describes one or more adverse drug reactions. MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) is a medical terminology introduced with the purpose to standardize and facilitate the sharing of information about medicinal products in particular with respect to regulatory activities BIBREF5 . The description of a suspected ADR through narrative text could seem redundant/useless. Indeed, one could reasonably imagine sound solutions based either on an autocompletion form or on a menu with MedDRA terms. In these solutions, the description of ADRs would be directly encoded by the reporter and no expert work for MedDRA terminology extraction would be required. However, such solutions are not completely suited for the pharmacovigilance domain and the narrative description of ADRs remains a desirable feature, for at least two reasons. First, the description of an ADR by means of one of the seventy thousand MedDRA terms is a complex task. In most cases, the reporter who points out the adverse reaction is not an expert in MedDRA terminology. This holds in particular for citizens, but it is still valid for several professionals. Thus, describing ADRs by means of natural language sentences is simpler. Second, the choice of the suitable term(s) from a given list or from an autocompletion field can influence the reporter and limit her/his expressiveness. As a consequence, the quality of the description would be also in this case undermined. Therefore, VigiFarmaco offers a free-text field for specifying the ADR with all the possible details, without any restriction about the content or strict limits to the length of the written text. Consequently, MedDRA encoding has then to be manually implemented by qualified people responsible for pharmacovigilance, before the transmission to RNF. As this work is expensive in terms of time and attention required, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur given the continuous growing of the number of reports."]}

It is worth noting that this test simply estimates how much, for each report, the MagiCoder behavior is similar to the manual work, without considering the effective quality of the manual encoding. Clearly, as a set of official reports, revised and sent to RNF, we assume to deal with an high-quality encoding: notwithstanding, some errors in the human encoding possibly occur. Moreover, the query we perform to compare manual and automatic encoding is, obviously, quantitative. For each VigiSegn report, the query is able to detect common retrieved terms and terms returned either by the human expert or by MagiCoder. It is not able to fairly test redundancy errors: human experts make some encoding choices in order to avoid repetitions. Thus, an LLT INLINEFORM0 returned by MagiCoder that has not been selected by the expert because redundant is not truly a false positive.

In this way, we do not consider an error when MagiCoder and the human expert use two different LLTs for representing the same adverse event. The use of the LLT level for reporting purpose and the PT level for analysis purpose is suggested also by MedDRA BIBREF5 . With common PT we mean the percentage of preferred terms retrieved by human reviewers that have been recognized also by MagiCoder. Reported performances are summarized also in FIGREF59 .

Specifically, we see the importance of using GloVe as pre-trained word embeddings, how word dropout improves generalization, and how context size plays an important role in the final classification result (showing one of our experiments).", "From the results of Table TABREF19 , we notice our single WSD network, despite eliminating the problem of having a large number of WSD classifiers, still falls short when is compared with the state-of-the-art WSD algorithms. Based on our intuition and supported by some of our preliminary experiments, this deficiency stems from an important factor in our BLSTM network. Since no sense embedding is made publicly available for use, the sense embeddings are initialized randomly; yet, word embeddings are initialized by pre-trained GloVe vectors in order to benefit from the semantic and syntactic properties of the context words conveyed by these embeddings. That is to say, the separate spaces that the sense embeddings and the (context) word embeddings come from enforces some delay for the alignment of these spaces which in turn demands more training data. Furthermore, this early misalignment does not allow the BLSTM fully take advantage of larger context sizes which can be helpful. Our first attempt to deal with such problem was to pre-train the sense embeddings by some techniques - such as taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) definition content words of senses, or taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) context words in their training samples - did not give us a better result than our random initialization. Our preliminary experiments though in which we replaced all GloVe embeddings in the network with sense embeddings (using a method proposed by Chen et al. BIBREF11 ), showed considerable improvements in the results of some ambiguous words. That means both senses and context words (while they can be ambiguous by themselves) come from one vector space. In other words, the context would also be represented by the possible senses that its words can take. This idea not only can help to improve the results of the current model, it can also avoid the need for a large amount of training data since senses can be seen in both places, center and context, to be trained."]}

This means that INLINEFORM0 learned from English can successfully encode the sequential phonetic structures into fixed-length vector for the target languages to some good extend even though it has never seen any audio data of the target languages. Another interesting fact is the corresponding variance between languages. In the source language, English, the variances of the five edit distance groups are fixed at 0.030, which means that the cosine similarity in each edit distance group is centralized. However, the variances of the groups in the target languages vary. In French and German, the variance grows from 0.030 to 0.060 as the edit distance increases from 0 to 4. For Czech/Spanish, the variance starts at a larger value of 0.040/0.050 and increases to 0.050/0.073. We suspect that the fluctuating variance is related to the similarity between languages.

In this paper, we describe briefly the whole workflow and present a prototype implementation. Currently, existing solutions for sentiment annotation offer mostly analysis on the level of entire documents, and if you go deeper to the level of individual product features, they are only superficial and poorly prepared for the analysis of large volumes of data. This can especially be seen in scientific articles where the analysis is carried out on a few hundred reviews only. It is worth mentioning that this task is extremely problematic because of the huge diversity of languages and the difficulty of building a single solution that can cover all the languages used in the world. Natural language analysis often requires additional pre-processing steps, especially at the stage of preparing the data for analysis, and steps specific for each language. Large differences can be seen in the analysis of the Polish language (a highly inflected language) and English (a grammatically simpler one). We propose a solution that will cover several languages, however in this prototype implementation we focused on English texts only.", "A sentiment analysis can be made at the level of (1) the whole document, (2) the individual sentences, or (what is currently seen as the most attractive approach) (3) at the level of individual fragments of text. Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 ."]}

Consequently, of late, a new line of research has focused on creating representations of users in a social network by leveraging the information derived from the connections that they have with other users. In this case, node representations (where nodes represent the authors in the social network) are typically induced using neural architectures. Given the graph representing the social network, such methods create low-dimensional representations for each node, which are optimized to predict the nodes close to it in the network. This approach has the advantage of overcoming the absence of information that the previous approaches face. Among those that implement this idea are Yang et al. yang2016toward, who used representations derived from a social graph to achieve better performance in entity linking tasks, and Chen and Ku chen2016utcnn, who used them for stance classification.", "We conduct a qualitative analysis of system errors and the cases where author profiling leads to the correct classification of previously misclassified examples. Table 3 shows examples of hateful tweets from the dataset that are misclassified by the lr method, but are correctly classified upon the addition of author profiling features, i.e., by the lr + auth method. It is worth noting that some of the wins scored by the latter are on tweets that are part of a larger hateful discourse or contain links to hateful content while not explicitly having textual cues that are indicative of hate speech per se. The addition of author profiling features may then be viewed as a proxy for wider discourse information, thus allowing us to correctly resolve the cases where lexical and semantic features alone are insufficient."]}

This contrast can be explained by the fact that tweets in the racism class come from only 5 unique authors who: (i) are isolated in the community graph, or (ii) have also authored several tweets in the sexism class, or (iii) are densely connected to authors from the sexism and none classes which possibly camouflages their racist nature.", "In this paper, we answer these questions and develop novel methods that take into account community-based profiling features of authors when examining their tweets for hate speech.

We consider events for which a person is the subject (e.g, \u201cPersonX listens to PersonX's music\u201d) to be human activities, and remove the rest (e.g., \u201cIt is Christmas morning\u201d). We then use several simple rules to convert the Event2Mind instances into first-person past-tense activities. Since all events were already filtered so that they begin with \u201cPersonX\u201d, we replace the first occurrence of \u201cPersonX\u201d in each event with \u201cI\u201d and all subsequent occurrences with \u201cme\u201d.

We explicitly group the set of these properties into two categories: syntactic and social. Syntactic category includes properties such as tweet length, the order of words in it, the words themselves, slang words, hashtags and named entities in the tweet. On the other hand, social properties consist of `is reply', and `reply time'. We investigate the degree to which the tweet representations encode these properties. We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task). In this work we perform an extensive evaluation of 9 unsupervised and 4 supervised tweet representation models, using 8 different properties. The most relevant work is that of Adi et al. [5], which investigates three sentence properties in comparing unsupervised sentence representation models such as average of words vectors and LSTM auto-encoders. We differ from their work in two ways: (1) While they focus on sentences, we focus on social media posts which opens up the challenge of considering multiple salient properties such as hashtags, named entities, conversations and so on. (2) While they work with only unsupervised representation-learning models, we investigate the traditional unsupervised methods (BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW, Tweet2Vec), as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM).", "This work proposed a set of elementary property prediction tasks to understand different tweet representations in an application independent, fine-grained fashion. The open nature of social media not only poses a plethora of opportunities to understand the basic characteristics of the posts, but also helped us draw novel insights about different representation models. We observed that among supervised models, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM encapsulates most of the syntactic and social properties with a great accuracy, while BOW, DSSM, STV and T2V does that among the unsupervised models. Tweet length affects the task prediction accuracies, but we found that all models behave similarly under variation in tweet length. Finally while LDA is insensitive to input word order, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM are extremely sensitive to word order."]}

Opinion summarization is the task of automatically generating summaries for a set of opinions about a specific target BIBREF0. Figure FIGREF1 shows various reviews about the movie \u201cCoach Carter\u201d and example summaries generated by humans and automatic systems. The vast majority of previous work BIBREF1 views opinion summarization as the final stage of a three-step process involving: (1) aspect extraction (i.e., finding features pertaining to the target of interest, such as battery life or sound quality); (2) sentiment prediction (i.e., determining the sentiment of the extracted aspects); and (3) summary generation (i.e., presenting the identified opinions to the user). Textual summaries are created following mostly extractive methods which select representative segments (usually sentences) from the source text BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Despite being less popular, abstractive approaches seem more appropriate for the task at hand as they attempt to generate summaries which are maximally informative and minimally redundant without simply rearranging passages from the original opinions BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. General-purpose summarization approaches have recently shown promising results with end-to-end models which are data-driven and take advantage of the success of sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures. Most approaches BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13 encode documents and then decode the learned representations into an abstractive summary, often by attending to the source input BIBREF14 and copying words from it BIBREF15. Under this modeling paradigm, it is no longer necessary to identify aspects and their sentiment for the opinion summarization task, as these are learned indirectly from training data (i.e., sets of opinions and their corresponding summaries). These models are usually tested on domains where the input is either one document or a small set of documents. However, the number of opinions tends to be very large (150 for the example in Figure FIGREF1). It is therefore practically unfeasible to train a model in an end-to-end fashion, given the memory limitations of modern hardware. As a result, current approaches BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19 sacrifice end-to-end elegance in favor of a two-stage framework which we call Extract-Abstract: an extractive model first selects a subset of opinions and an abstractive model then generates the summary while conditioning on the extracted subset (see Figure FIGREF5). The extractive pass unfortunately has two drawbacks. Firstly, on account of having access to a subset of opinions, the summaries can be less informative and inaccurate, as shown in Figure FIGREF1. And secondly, user preferences cannot be easily taken into account (e.g., the reader may wish to obtain a summary focusing on the acting or plot of a movie as opposed to a general-purpose summary) since more specialized information might have been removed.", "Most opinion summarization models follow extractive methods (see BIBREF21 and BIBREF22 for overviews), with the exception of a few systems which are able to generate novel words and phrases not featured in the source text. BIBREF6 propose a graph-based framework for generating ultra concise opinion summaries, while BIBREF8 represent reviews by discourse trees which they aggregate to a global graph from which they generate a summary. Other work BIBREF7, BIBREF23 takes the distribution of opinions and their aspects into account so as to generate more readable summaries. BIBREF9 present a hybrid system which uses extractive techniques to select salient quotes from the input reviews and embeds them into an abstractive summary to provide evidence for positive or negative opinions. More recent work has seen the effective application of sequence-to-sequence models BIBREF24, BIBREF14 to various abstractive summarization tasks including headline generation BIBREF10, single- BIBREF15, BIBREF25, and multi-document summarization BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18. Closest to our approach is the work of BIBREF16 who generate opinion summaries following a two-stage process which first selects documents bearing pertinent information, and then generates the summary by conditioning on these documents. Specifically, they use a ridge regression model with hand-engineered features such as TF-IDF scores and word counts, to estimate the importance of a document relative to its cluster (see also BIBREF17 for a survey of additional document selection methods). The extracted documents are then concatenated into a long sequence and fed to an encoder-decoder model. Our proposed framework eliminates the need to pre-select salient documents which we argue leads to information loss and less flexible generation capability. Instead, a separate model first condenses the source documents into multiple dense vectors which serve as input to a decoder to generate an abstractive summary. Beyond producing more informative summaries, we demonstrate that our approach allows to customize them. Recent conditional generation models have focused on controlling various aspects of the output such as politeness BIBREF26, length BIBREF27, BIBREF28, content BIBREF28, or style BIBREF29. In contrast to these approaches, our customization technique requires neither training examples of documents and corresponding (customized) summaries nor specialized pre-processing to encode which tokens in the input might give rise to customization."]}

For example, we did not integrate spell-checking in our re-ranking method which proved to be effective in our baseline evaluation. Further, the re-ranking model is based on very simple features.

A major limitation is that the re-ranking algorithm cannot choose answer candidates beyond the top-10 results. It would be interesting to classify whether an answer is present in the top-10 or not. If not, the algorithm could search outside the top-10 results.

In this paper we look at this incredible journey. We start by looking at early rule-based methods which consisted of hand engineered features, most of which were domain specific. However, in our view, the advent of neural networks that were capable of capturing long term dependencies in text and the creation of the sequence to sequence learning model BIBREF1 that was capable of handling utterances of varying length is what truly revolutionized the field. Since the sequence to sequence model was first used to build a neural conversational agent BIBREF2 in 2016 the field has exploded. With a multitude of new approaches being proposed in the last two years which significantly impact the quality of these conversational agents, we skew our paper towards the post 2016 era. Indeed one of the key features of this paper is that it surveys the exciting new developments in the domain of conversational agents.", "In this survey paper we explored the exciting and rapidly changing field of conversational agents. We talked about the early rule-based methods that depended on hand-engineered features. These methods laid the ground work for the current models. However these models were expensive to create and the features depended on the domain that the conversational agent was created for. It was hard to modify these models for a new domain. As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents. Sequence to sequence model created in 2015 was capable of handling utterances of variable lengths, the application of sequence to sequence to conversation agents truly revolutionized the domain. After this advancement the field has literally exploded with numerous application in the last couple of years. The results have been impressive enough to find their way into commercial applications such that these agents have become truly ubiquitous. We attempt to present a broad view of these advancements with a focus on the main challenges encountered by the conversational agents and how these new approaches are trying to mitigate them."]}

This, in theory, can be done by using only entropy. A simple alignment could be made by using word entropies in both languages and aligning the words by decreasing entropy. This would work better for translating into a language with no articles. A better approach, which was not beyond the thinking of the group since it was already proposed by Matkovi\u0107 in his dissertation from 1957 BIBREF20, would be to use word bigrams and align them. It is worth mentioning that, although the idea of machine translation in the 1950s in Croatia did not have a significant influence on development of the field, it shows that Croatian linguists had contemporary views and necessary competencies for its development. But, unfortunately, the development of machine translation in Croatia had been stopped because of the previously discussed circumstances. In 1964, Laszlo went to the USA, where he spent the next seven years, and after returning to Croatia, he was active as a university professor, but because of disagreement with the ruling political option regarding Croatian language issues, he published very rarely and was mainly focused on other linguistic issues in that period, but his work was a major influence on the later development of computational linguistics in Croatia.", "Several remarks are in order. First, the group seemed to think that encodings would be needed, but it seems that entropy-based encodings and calculations added no real benefits (i.e. added no benefit that would not be offset by the cost of calculating the codes). In addition, Finka and Laszlo BIBREF10 seem to place great emphasis on lemmatization instead of stemming, which, if they had constructed a prototype, they would have noticed it to be very hard to tackle with the technology of the age. Nevertheless, the idea of proper lemmatization would probably be replaced with moderately precise hard-coded stemming, made with the help of the \"inverse dictionary\", which Finka and Laszlo proposed as one of the key tasks in their 1962 paper. This paper also highlights the need for a frequency count and taking only the most frequent words, which is an approach that later became widely used in the natural language processing community. Sentential alignment coupled with part-of-speech tagging was correctly identified as one of the key aspects of machine translation, but its complexity was severely underestimated by the group. One might argue that these two modules are actually everything that is needed for a successful machine translation system, which shows the complexity of the task."]}

This was based on previous calculations of language entropy by Matkovi\u0107, and Matkovi\u0107's idea was simple: conduct a statistical analysis to determine the most frequent letters and assign them the shortest binary code. So A would get 101, while F would get 11010011 BIBREF11. Building on that, Laszlo suggested that, when making an efficient machine translation system, one has to take into account not just the letter frequencies but also the redundancies of some of the letters in a word BIBREF16. This suggests that the strategy would be as follows: first make a thesaurus, and pick a representative for each meaning, then stem or lemmatize the words, then remove the needless letters from words (i.e. letters that carry little information, such as vowels, but being careful not to equate two different words), and then encode the words in binary strings, using the letter frequencies. After that, the texts are ready for translation, but unfortunately, the translation method is never explicated. Nevertheless, it is hinted that it should be \"cybernetic\", which, along with what we have presented earlier, would most probably mean artificial neural networks. This is highlighted by the following passage (BIBREF11, p. 117):", "Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 BIBREF11 considered cybernetics (as described in BIBREF13 by Wiener, who invented the term \u201ccybernetics\u201d) to be the best approach for machine translation in the long run. The question is whether Laszlo's idea of cybernetics would drive the research of the group towards artificial neural networks. Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\". This seems to suggest that they were aware of the efforts of logicians (such as Bar Hillel, and to some degree Pitts, since Wiener specifically mentions logicians-turned-cyberneticists in his book BIBREF13), but still concluded that a cybernetic approach would probably be a better choice."]}

The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8. It is also interesting to note that the Andreev group had a profound influence on the Czechoslovakian machine translation program BIBREF9, which unfortunately suffered a similar fate as the Yugoslav one due to the lack of funding.", "Andreev's approach was in a sense \"external\". The modelling would be statistical, but its purpose would not be to mimic the stochasticity of the human thought process, but rather to produce a working machine translation system. Kulagina and Melchuk disagreed with this approach as they thought that more of what is presently called \"philosophical logic\" was needed to model the human thought process at the symbolic level, and according to them, the formalization of the human thought process was a prerequisite for developing a machine translation system (cf. BIBREF6). We could speculate that sub-symbolic processing would have been acceptable too, since that approach is also rooted in philosophical logic as a way of formalizing human cognitive functions and is also \"internal\" in the same sense symbolic approaches are."]}

We analyze the propaganda material they publish in their online English magazine called Dabiq, and use data-mining techniques to computationally uncover contextual text and psychological properties associated with these groups. From our analysis of these texts, we are able to extract a set of signals that provide some insight into the mindset of the radical group.

During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety.

Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC.

It measures how well the language model predicts a sample. However, it is not good at measuring how well the output of the language model matches a target language style. Another measure, the BLEU score algorithm BIBREF4 , has been widely used for the automatic evaluation of the model output. However, it cannot be applied directly to measuring a quality of the personalized model output because it considers the similarity between one language and the target language. Other research was conducted on proving authorship and fraud in literature, for instance, Jane Austen's left-over novel with partially completed BIBREF5 . This research counted the occurrence of several words in the literature, compared their relative frequencies with those of the words in the target literature, and concluded that the target literature was a forgery. This approach could be applied to a text evaluation where a large amount of data is available and certain words are used more frequently. In spoken language, such as in the message-reply case, however, whole word distribution must be considered instead of considering the occurrence of several words, because the data is usually not enough than the literature case. So, we use a simple and efficient metric to measure the similarity between the user style and the output of the personalized model."]}

Our intuition is that the task of hate-speech detection can be further benefited by the incorporation of other sources of information to be used as features into a supervised learning model. A simple statistical analysis on an existing annotated dataset of tweets by BIBREF5 , can easily reveal the existence of significant correlation between the user tendency in expressing opinions that belong to some offensive class (Racism or Sexism), and the annotation labels associated with that class. More precisely, the correlation coefficient value that describes such user tendency was found to be 0.71 for racism in the above dataset, while that value reached as high as 0.76 for sexism.

As a result, our approach improves the understanding of spontaneous conversations by recognizing semantically important transcription segments while adding minimal computational overhead.

Intent annotations which span at least three words are more likely to rescore the lattice correctly than to introduce a false positive. These results also lead us to a practical heuristic, that an intent annotation which spans only one or two words should not be considered for rescoring. Application of this heuristic results in an estimated accuracy of 77%. We use this heuristic in further experiments. A stricter heuristic would require at least four words span, with an accuracy of 87.7%.

These are combined using a constraint-based solver that considers not only the semantic similarity of the synsets but also the overall structure of the alignment and its consistency, following the best practices in ontology alignment."]}

The situation on Twitter is similar: most false positives are in Russia and Eastern Europe, but in Twitter there are also over-predicted languages in the US and Canada, South Africa, France, India, and Australia. This is important because it shows that relying on Twitter alone would indicate that there are more diverse language speaking populations in these countries.

For Russia, on the other hand, which is not included in Eastern Europe, the false positive rate cannot be explained in reference to general over-representation.

However, the definitions of \u201cgray-box\u201d attacks are quite different in each of these approaches. In this paper, we focus on \u201cblack-box\u201d setting where we assume that the adversary possesses a limited set of labeled data, which is different from the target's training data, and also has an oracle access to the system, i.e., one can query the target classifier with any input and get its corresponding predictions. We propose an effective technique to generate adversarial examples in a black-box setting. We develop an Adversarial Example Generator (AEG) model that uses a reinforcement learning framing to generate adversarial examples. We evaluate our models using a word-based BIBREF11 and character-based BIBREF12 text classification model on benchmark classification tasks: sentiment classification and news categorization. The adversarial sequences generated are able to effectively fool the classifiers without changing the semantics of the text. Our contributions are as follows:", "In this work, we have introduced a $AEG$, a model capable of generating adversarial text examples to fool the black-box text classification models. Since we do not have access to gradients or parameters of the target model, we modelled our problem using a reinforcement learning based approach. In order to effectively baseline the REINFORCE algorithm for policy-gradients, we implemented a self-critical approach that normalizes the rewards obtained by sampled sentences with the rewards obtained by the model under test-time inference algorithm. By generating adversarial examples for target word and character-based models trained on IMDB reviews and AG's news dataset, we find that our model is capable of generating semantics-preserving perturbations that leads to steep decrease in accuracy of those target models. We conducted ablation studies to find the importance of individual components of our system. Extremely low values of the certain reward coefficient constricts the quantitative performance of the model can also lead to semantic divergence. Therefore, the choice of a particular value for this model should be motivated by the demands of the context in which it is applied. One of the main challenges of such approaches lies in the ability to produce more synthetic data to train the generator model in the distribution of the target model's training data. This can significantly improve the performance of our model. We hope that our method motivates a more nuanced exploration into generating adversarial examples and adversarial training for building robust classification models."]}

The results are obtained using pyrouge package. The performance of various models and our improvements are summarized in Table TABREF37. A direct implementation of NSE performed very poorly due to the simple dot-product attention mechanism. In NMT, a transformation from word-vectors in one language to another one (say English to French) using a mere matrix multiplication is enough because of the one-to-one correspondence between words and the underlying linear structure imposed in learning the word vectors BIBREF23. However, in text summarization a word (sentence) could be a condensation of a group of words (sentences). Therefore, using a complex neural network-based attention mechanism proposed improved the performance. Both dot-product and additive BIBREF11 mechanisms perform similarly for the NMT task, but the difference is more pronounced for the text summarization task simply because of the nature of the problem as described earlier. Replacing Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) in the NSE with an LSTM further improved the performance because it remembers what was previously composed and facilitates the composition of novel words. This also eliminates the need for additional mechanisms to penalize repetitions such as coverage BIBREF2 and intra-attention BIBREF18.

However, instead of using a random mask as in SpecAugment, our approach masks out the whole patch of the features corresponding to an output token during training, e.g., a word or a word-piece.

We compare the performance of using the 3-part L2 hinge loss to the original loss presented for each model. Across all baselines, matching performance of the model improves using the 3-part L2 hinge loss. ARC-II and Match Pyramid ranking performance is similar or lower when using the 3-part loss. Ranking performance improves for DSSM, possibly because the original approach uses only random negatives to approximate the softmax normalization. More complex models, like Match Pyramid and ARC-II, had significantly lower matching and ranking performance while taking significantly longer to train and evaluate. These models are also much harder to tune and tend to overfit.", " BIBREF7 introduced Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which computes a low-rank factorization of a term-document matrix to identify semantic concepts and was further refined by BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 and extended by ideas from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) BIBREF10 in BIBREF11 . In 2013, BIBREF12 published the seminal paper in the space of factorized models by introducing the Deep Semantic Similarity Model (DSSM). Inspired by LSA and Semantic Hashing BIBREF13 , DSSM involves training an end-to-end deep neural network with a discriminative loss to learn a fixed-width representation for queries and documents. Fully connected units in the DSSM architecture were subsequently replaced with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) BIBREF16 to respect word ordering. In an alternate approach, which articulated the idea of interaction models, BIBREF17 introduced the Deep Relevance Matching Model (DRMM) which leverages an interaction matrix to capture local term matching within neural approaches which has been successfully extended by MatchPyramid BIBREF18 and other techniques BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . Nevertheless, these interaction methods require memory and computation proportional to the number of words in the document and hence are prohibitively expensive for online inference. In addition, Duet BIBREF24 combines the approaches of DSSM and DRMM to balance the importance of semantic and lexical matching. Despite obtaining state-of-the-art results for ranking, these methods report limited success on ad hoc retrieval tasks BIBREF24 and only achieve a sub-50% Recall@100 and MAP on our product matching dataset, as shown with the ARC-II and Match Pyramid baselines in Table TABREF30 ."]}

However, the decoding speed is significantly worse since the decoder needs to apply INLINEFORM0 NMT models rather than only one. Therefore, a recent line of research transfers the idea of knowledge distillation BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 to NMT and trains a smaller network (the student) by minimizing the cross-entropy to the output of the ensemble system (the teacher) BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . This paper presents an alternative to knowledge distillation as we aim to speed up decoding to be comparable to single NMT while retaining the boost in translation accuracy from the ensemble. In a first step, we describe how to construct a single large neural network which imitates the output of an ensemble of multiple networks with the same topology. We will refer to this process as unfolding. GPU-based decoding with the unfolded network is often much faster than ensemble decoding since more work can be done on the GPU. In a second step, we explore methods to reduce the size of the unfolded network. This idea is justified by the fact that ensembled neural networks are often over-parameterized and have a large degree of redundancy BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . Shrinking the unfolded network leads to a smaller model which consumes less space on the disk and in the memory; a crucial factor on mobile devices. More importantly, the decoding speed on all platforms benefits greatly from the reduced number of neurons. We find that the dimensionality of linear embedding layers in the NMT network can be reduced heavily by low-rank matrix approximation based on singular value decomposition (SVD). This suggest that high dimensional embedding layers may be needed for training, but do not play an important role for decoding. The NMT network, however, also consists of complex layers like gated recurrent units BIBREF18 and attention BIBREF19 . Therefore, we introduce a novel algorithm based on linear combinations of neurons which can be applied either during training (data-bound) or directly on the weight matrices without using training data (data-free). We report that with a mix of the presented shrinking methods we are able to reduce the size of the unfolded network to the size of the single NMT network while keeping the boost in BLEU score from the ensemble. Depending on the aggressiveness of shrinking, we report either a gain of 2.2 BLEU at the same decoding speed, or a 3.4 INLINEFORM1 CPU decoding speed up with only a minor drop in BLEU compared to the original single NMT system. Furthermore, it is often much easier to stage a single NMT system than an ensemble in a commercial MT workflow, and it is crucial to be able to optimize quality at specific speed and memory constraints. Unfolding and shrinking address these problems directly."]}

It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier).

By considering latitudinal variability it appeared that, overall, people living in the northern part of the country used a less standard language, i.e., negated and pluralized less standardly, and used a smaller number of words. On the other hand, people from the South used a language which is somewhat closer to the standard (in terms of the aforementioned linguistic markers) and a more diverse vocabulary. The most notable exception is Paris, where in the city center people used more standard language, while the contrary is true for the suburbs. This observation, better shown in Fig. 3 a inset, can be explained by the large differences in average socioeconomic status between districts. Such segregation is known to divide the Eastern and Western sides of suburban Paris, and in turn to induce apparent geographic patterns of standard language usage. We found less evident longitudinal dependencies of the observed variables. Although each variable shows a somewhat diagonal trend, the most evident longitudinal dependency appeared for the average rate of standard pluralization (see Fig. 3 b), where users from the Eastern side of the country used the language in less standard ways. Note that we also performed a multivariate regression analysis (not shown here), using the linguistic markers as target and considering as factors both location (in terms of latitude and longitude) as and income as proxy of socioeconomic status.

As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when \u201cnurse\u201d is replaced by \u201cengineer\u201d. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions \u2013 which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias \u2013, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( \u201cComputer occupations, all other\u201d, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (\u201chost/hostess\u201d, \u201cwaiter/waitress\u201d). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 .

For example, the semantic differences between an essay on gun-control and a student talking about getting a gun can be very subtle. Sometimes our systems include essays on emotive topics because the difference in language between such essays and alerts can be very small. Students often use phrases like \u201ckill me now\" as hyperbole out of frustration rather than a genuine desire to end ones life, e.g., \"this test is so boring, kill me now\".

However, encoder\u2019s contextual representations are uncertain when dealing with long-range dependencies. To address these drawbacks, Vaswani et al. in BIBREF80 introduced a novel network architecture, called Transformer, relying entirely on self-attention units to map input sequences to output sequences without the use of RNNs. The Transformer\u2019s decoder unit architecture contains a masked multi-head attention layer followed by a multi-head attention unit and a feed forward network whereas the decoder unit is almost identical without the masked attention unit. Multi-head self-attention layers are calculated in parallel facing the computational costs of regular attention layers used by previous seq2seq network architectures. In BIBREF18 the authors presented a model that is founded on findings from various previous studies (e.g., BIBREF83, BIBREF84, BIBREF64, BIBREF49, BIBREF80), which achieved state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, called BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The BERT training process is split in two phases, the unsupervised pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase using labelled data for down-streaming tasks. In contrast with previous proposed models (e.g., BIBREF64, BIBREF49), BERT uses masked language models (MLMs) to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. In the pre-training phase the model is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data from Wikipedia, BookCorpus BIBREF85 and WordPiece BIBREF86 embeddings. In this training part, the model was tested on two tasks; on the first task, the model randomly masks 15% of the input tokens aiming to capture conceptual representations of word sequences by predicting masked words inside the corpus, whereas in the second task the model is given two sentences and tries to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence of the first. In the second phase, BERT is extended with a task-related classifier model that is trained on a supervised manner. During this supervised phase, the pre-trained BERT model receives minimal changes, with the classifier\u2019s parameters trained in order to minimize the loss function. Two models presented in BIBREF18, a \u201cBase Bert\u201d model with 12 encoder layers (i.e. transformer blocks), feed-forward networks with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads, and a \u201cLarge Bert\u201d model with 24 encoder layers 1024 feed-the pre-trained Bert model, an architecture almost identical with the aforementioned Transformer network. A [CLS] token is supplied in the input as the first token, the final hidden state of which is aggregated for classification tasks. Despite the achieved breakthroughs, the BERT model suffers from several drawbacks. Firstly, BERT, as all language models using Transformers, assumes (and pre-supposes) independence between the masked words from the input sequence, and neglects all the positional and dependency information between words. In other words, for the prediction of a masked token both word and position embeddings are masked out, even if positional information is a key-aspect of NLP BIBREF87. In addition, the [MASK] token which, is substituted with masked words, is mostly absent in fine-tuning phase for down-streaming tasks, leading to a pre-training fine-turning discrepancy. To address the cons of BERT, a permutation language model was introduced, so-called XLnet, trained to predict masked tokens in a non-sequential random order, factorizing likelihood in an autoregressive manner without the independence assumption and without relying on any input corruption BIBREF88. In particular, a query stream is used that extends embedding representations to incorporate positional information about the masked words. The original representation set (content stream), including both token and positional embeddings, is then used as input to the query stream following a scheme called \u201cTwo-Stream SelfAttention\u201d. To overcome the problem of slow convergence the authors propose the prediction of the last token in the permutation phase, instead of predicting the entire sequence. Finally, XLnet uses also a special token for the classification and separation of the input sequence, [CLS] and [SEP] respectively, however it also learns an embedding that denotes whether the two words are from the same segment. This is similar to relative positional encodings introduced in TrasformerXL BIBREF87, and extents the ability of XLnet to cope with tasks that encompass arbitrary input segments. Recently, a replication study, BIBREF18, suggested several modifications in the training procedure of BERT which, outperforms the original XLNet architecture on several NLP tasks. The optimized model, called Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), used 10 times more data (160GB compared with the 16GB originally exploited), and is trained with far more epochs than the BERT model (500K vs 100K), using also 8-times larger batch sizes, and a byte-level BPE vocabulary instead of the character-level vocabulary that was previously utilized. Another significant modification, was the dynamic masking technique instead of the single static mask used in BERT. In addition, RoBERTa model removes the next sentence prediction objective used in BERT, following advises by several other studies that question the NSP loss term BIBREF89, BIBREF90, BIBREF91.", "Due to the limitations of annotated datasets and the high cost of data collection, unsupervised learning approaches tend to be an easier way towards training networks. Recently, transfer learning approaches, i.e., the transfer of already acquired knowledge to new conditions, are gaining attention in several domain adaptation problems BIBREF72. In fact, pre-trained embeddings representations, such as GloVe, ElMo and USE, coupled with transfer learning architectures were introduced and managed to achieve state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks BIBREF73. In this chapter we review on these methodologies in order to introduce our approach. In this chapter we will summarize those methods and introduce our proposed transfer learning system.

On the contrary ironic/sarcastic expressions presupposes the processing of both the indirectly rejected and the implied message so that the difference between them can be identified. This view differs from the assumption that irony and sarcasm involve only one interpretation BIBREF28, BIBREF29. Holding that irony activates both grammatical / explicit as well as ironic / involved notions provides that irony will be more difficult to grasp than a non-ironic use of the same expression.", "Recently, the detection of ironic and sarcastic meanings from respective literal ones have raised scientific interest due to the intrinsic difficulties to differentiate between them.

Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks. On the other hand, Waseem and Hovy noted that INLINEFORM1 of all the disagreements in annotation of their dataset occurred on the sexism class. Sexism is typically both generalized and implicit.", "Modeling wider conversation. Abuse is inherently contextual; it can only be interpreted as part of a wider conversation between users on the Internet. This means that individual comments can be difficult to classify without modeling their respective contexts. However, the vast majority of existing approaches have focused on modeling the lexical, semantic and syntactic properties of comments in isolation from other comments. Mishra et al. mishra have pointed out that some tweets in data-twitter-wh do not contain sufficient lexical or semantic information to detect abuse even in principle, e.g., @user: Logic in the world of Islam http://t.co/xxxxxxx, and techniques for modeling discourse and elements of pragmatics are needed. To address this issue, Gao and Huang gao2017detecting, working with data-fox-news, incorporate features from two sources of context: the title of the news article for which the comment was posted, and the screen name of the user who posted it. Yet this is only a first step towards modeling the wider context in abuse detection; more sophisticated techniques are needed to capture the history of the conversation and the behavior of the users as it develops over time. NLP techniques for modeling discourse and dialogue can be a good starting point in this line of research. However, since posts on social media often includes data of multiple modalities (e.g., a combination of images and text), abuse detection systems would also need to incorporate a multi-modal component."]}

The perfor-mance of Baseline_2 is better than that of \u201cBaseline_1\u201d. This can be mainly credited to the ability of abundant lexical and syntax features. Our parser shows better per-formance than Baselin_2 because the most of features we use are textual type fea-tures, which are convenient for the maximum entropy model. Though the textual type features can turn into numeric type according to hashcode of string, it is incon-venient for Support Vector Machine because the hashcode of string is not continu-ous. According the performance of the parser, we find that the connective identifying can achieve higher precision and recall rate. In addition, the precision and recall rate of identifying Arg2 is higher than that of identifying Arg1 because Arg2 has stronger syntax link with connective compared to Arg1. The sense has three layers: class, type and subtype."]}

The arguments identifier locates the two arguments of \u201cunless\u201d. The sense classifier labels the dis-course relation. The non-explicit identifier checks all the pair of adjacent sentences. If the non-explicit identifier indentifies the pair of sentences as non-explicit relation, it will label it the relation sense. Though many research work BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 are committed to the shallow discourse parsing field, all of them are focus on the subtask of parsing only rather than the whole parsing process. Given all that, a full shallow discourse parser framework is proposed in our paper to turn the free text into discourse relations set. The parser includes connective identifier, arguments identifier, sense classifier and non-explicit identifier, which connects with each other in pipeline. In order to enhance the performance of the parser, the feature-based maximum entropy model approach is adopted in the experiment. Maximum entropy model offers a clean way to combine diverse pieces of contextual evidence in order to estimate the probability of a certain linguistic class occurring with a certain linguistic context in a simple and accessible manner. The three main contributions of the paper are:", "We design a complete discourse parser connecting subtasks together in pipeline. First let\u2019s have a quick view about the procedure of the parser. The first step is pre-processing, which takes the raw text as input and generates POS tag of token, the dependency tree, constituent tree and so on. Next the parser needs to distinguish the connective between discourse usage and non-discourse usage. Then, the two argu-ments of discourse connective need to be identified. Next to above steps, the parser labels the discourse relation right sense. Until now the explicit relations already have been found fully. The last step is indentifying the non-explicit relation. The parser will handle every pair of adjacent sentences in same paragraph. The text is pre-processed by the Stanford CoreNLP tools. Stanford CoreNLP provides a series of natural language analysis tools which can tokenize the text, label tokens with their part-of-speech (POS) tag, and provides full syntactic analysis, in-cluding both constituent and dependency representation. The parser uses Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to preprocess the raw text. Next, each component of the parser will be described in detail."]}

The network constructed with no threshold in place was detected to have 18 distinct communities with three single node communities. Based on the visualized network (see Figure.FIGREF13), it seemed that the network community detection method clustered the sentence network as good as the original data set with human labeled classes although the communities do not look quite distinct. However, based on the fact that it had three single node communities and the number of distinct communities is less than the number of classes in the human labeled data set, we suspected possible problems that would degrade the quality of the community detection for the use of training text classification models.", "Once we got the optimal connectivity threshold using the Class_split and Class_merge scores as shown above sections, we built the sentence network with the optimal threshold of 0.5477.

This actually can help improve the text classification based systems to work more sophisticatedly as the data set gets more detailed subclasses to design the systems with. Although, it is indeed a helpful phenomena, we would like to minimize the number of subclasses created by the community detection algorithm simply because we want to avoid having too many subclasses that would add more complexity in designing any applications using the community data. On the other hand, the Class-merge happens when multiple human labeled classes are merged into one giant community. This Class-merge phenomena also helps improve the original data set by detecting either misslabeled or ambiguous data entries. We will discuss more details in the following subsection. Nonetheless, we also want to minimize the number of classes merged into the one giant community, because when too many classes are merged into one class, it simply implies that the sentence network is not correctly clustered. For example, as shown in Figure.FIGREF15 red lines, 12 different human labeled classes that do not share any similar intents are merged into COMMUNITY_7. If we trained a text classification model on this data, we would have lost the specifically designed purposes of the 12 different classes, expecting COMMUNITY_7 to deal with all the 12 different types of sentences.

We then averaged the Class-splits across all the human labeled classes and Class-merges across all the communities. For example, using the class map of the sentence network with no threshold, we can easily get the number of Class-split and Class-merge as below.

We adapt the self-learning models of BIBREF4 and BIBREF5 so that at each iteration they can align two words only if they share the same morphosyntactic category. Note that this limits the training data only to word forms present in UniMorph, as those are the only ones for which we have a gold tag. The results, a subset of which we present in Table TABREF35, show that the constraint, despite its simplicity and being trained on less data, leads to performance improvements for every Romance language pair and many of the Slavic language pairs.

To paint a complete picture of the models' generalization ability we propose a new experimental paradigm in which we independently control for four different variables: the word form's frequency, morphology, the lexeme frequency and the lexeme (a total of 480 experiments). Our comprehensive analysis reveals that BLI models can generalize for frequent morphosyntactic categories, even of infrequent lexemes, but fail to generalize for the more rare categories. This yields a more nuanced picture of the known deficiency of word embeddings to underperform on infrequent words BIBREF6. Our findings also contradict the strong empirical claims made elsewhere in the literature BIBREF4, BIBREF2, BIBREF5, BIBREF7, as we observe that performance severely degrades when the evaluation includes rare morphological variants of a word and infrequent lexemes. We picture this general trend in Figure FIGREF2, which also highlights the skew of existing dictionaries towards more frequent words. As our final contribution, we demonstrate that better encoding of morphology is indeed beneficial: enforcing a simple morphological constraint yields consistent performance improvements for all Romance language pairs and many of the Slavic language pairs.z"]}

Hybrid models are those that attempt to fuse these two approaches, by extracting knowledge from structured knowledge bases and using the resulting information to guide the learning paradigm of statistical estimators, such as deep neural network models.", "In section SECREF17, we describe context understanding for language tasks. Here, models are supplied with three separate modalities: external commonsense knowledge, unstructured textual context, and a series of answer candidates. In this task, models are tested on their ability to fuse together these disparate sources of information for making the appropriate logical inferences. We designed methods to extract adequate semantic structures (i.e., triples) from two comprehensive commonsense knowledge graphs, ConceptNet BIBREF6 and Atomic BIBREF7, and to inject this external context into language models. In general, open-domain linguistic context is useful for different tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including: information-extraction, text-classification, extractive and abstractive summarization, and question-answering (QA). For ease of quantitative evaluation, we consider a QA task in section SECREF17. In particular, the task is to select the correct answer from a pool of candidates, given a question that specifically requires commonsense to resolve. For example, the question, If electrical equipment won't power on, what connection should be checked? is associated with `company', `airport', `telephone network', `wires', and `freeway'(where `wires' is the correct answer choice). We demonstrate that our proposed hybrid architecture out-performs the state-of-the-art neural approaches that do not utilize structured commonsense knowledge bases. Furthermore, we discuss how our approach maintains explainability in the model's decision-making process: the model has the joint task of learning an attention distribution over the commonsense knowledge context which, in turn, depends on the knowledge triples that were conceptually most salient for selecting the correct answer candidate, downstream. Fundamentally, the goal of this project is to make human interaction with chatbots and personal assistants more robust. For this to happen, it is crucial to equip intelligent agents with a shared understanding of general contexts, i.e., commonsense. Conventionally, machine commonsense had been computationally articulated using symbolic languages|Cyc being one of the most prominent outcomes of this approach BIBREF8. However, symbolic commonsense representations are neither scalable nor comprehensive, as they depend heavily on the knowledge engineering experts that encode them. In this regard, the advent of deep learning and, in particular, the possibility of fusing symbolic knowledge into sub-symbolic (neural) layers, has recently led to a revival of this AI research topic."]}

The ensemble models also gained a performance boost of 4-5% comparing to previous methods. We suspect that the lower gain on RACE-H might result from the higher level of difficulty in those questions in RACE-H, as well as ambiguity in the dataset. Human performance drops from 85.1 on RACE-M to 69.4 on RACE-H, which indicates RACE-H is very challenging even for human.", "In this work, we propose a novel neural model - Dynamic Fusion Network (DFN), for MRC. For a given input sample, DFN can dynamically construct an model instance with a sample-specific network structure by picking an optimal attention strategy and an optimal number of reasoning steps on the fly. The capability allows DFN to adapt effectively to handling questions of different types. By training the policy of model construction with reinforcement learning, our DFN model can substantially outperform previous state-of-the-art MRC models on the challenging RACE dataset. Experiments show that by marrying dynamic fusion (DF) with multi-step reasoning (MR), the performance boost of DFN over baseline models is statistically significant. For future directions, we plan to incorporate more comprehensive attention strategies into the DFN model, and to apply the model to other challenging MRC tasks with more complex questions that need DF and MR jointly. Future extension also includes constructing a \u201ccomposable\u201d structure on the fly - by making the Dynamic Fusion Layer more flexible than it is now."]}

We find that without this pruning of the training data, accuracy of the KDG model drops to 36.3%. We consider this an important finding as the pruning step not only accounts for a large fraction of the improvement in the state-of-the-art KDG model but may also be relevant to training other models.

Such scoring models are typically used by grammar-based semantic parsers such as the one in BIBREF1 . Using the pruning algorithm, the scoring model can be trained to down-score spurious logical forms. Similarly, neural semantic parsers trained using reinforcement learning may use the pruning algorithm to only assign rewards to non-spurious logical forms."]}

Krippendorff's alpha can handle missing values, which in this case was necessary since many of the texts were annotated by only a few annotators.", "For both datasets $D_\\textrm {\\textit {LR}}$ and $D_\\textrm {\\textit {HR}}$, the trained models predict the Big Five traits better than the dummy regressor. This means that the trained models were able to catch signals of personality from the annotated data. Extraversion and agreeableness were easiest to estimate. The smallest differences in MAE between the trained models and the dummy regressor are for extraversion and conscientiousness, for models trained on the lower reliability dataset $D_\\textrm {\\textit {LR}}$. The explanation for this might be that both of the factors are quite complicated to detect in texts and therefore hard to annotate. For the models based on $D_\\textrm {\\textit {HR}}$, we can find a large difference between the MAE for both stability and agreeableness. Agreeableness measures for example how kind and sympathetic a person is, which appears much more naturally in text compared to extraversion and conscientiousness. Stability, in particular low stability, can be displayed in writing as expressions of emotions like anger or fear, and these are often easy to identify."]}
