On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal."]}

Surprisingly, the algorithm Liu does not perform significantly better than Yang when applied to instantaneous rumour detection although they claimed to operate in real-time. Liu et. al (2015) report performance based on the first 5 messages which clearly outperforms Yang for early rumour detection. However, we find that when reducing the set from 5 to 1, their superiority is only marginal. In contrast, the combination of novelty and pseudo relevance based features performs significantly better (sign test with $p < 0.05$ ) than the baselines for instantaneous rumour detections. Novelty based features benefit from news articles as an external data source, which explains their superior performance. In particular for instantaneous rumour detection, where information can only be obtained from a single message, the use of external data proves to perform superior. Note that accuracy is a single value metric describing performance at an optimal threshold. Figure 1 compares the effectiveness of the three algorithms for the full range of rumour scores for instantaneous detection. Different applications require a different balance between miss and false alarm. But the DET curve shows that Liu\u2019s method would be preferable over Yang for any application.

We found that adding CNN layer will decrease the accuracy in this scenario. Because when feeding into CNN, we have to reshape the feature planes otherwise convolution will not work. For example, we set convolution kernel width as 2, the input 2D tensor will have the shape lager than 2. To boost performance with CNN, we need more matching features.

In this paper, we propose a GPT-2 based uniformed framework for generating major types of Chinese classical poems. We define a unified format for formulating all types of training samples by integrating detailed form information, then present a simple form-stressed weighting method in GPT-2 to strengthen the control to the form of the generated poems, with special emphasis on those forms with longer body length. Preliminary experimental results show this enhanced model can generate Chinese classical poems of major types with high quality in both form and content, validating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Adding a token-weighted loss function and pretraining the decoder help the model's coherence according to BLEU and accuracy. Adding the detector (modular) or a BERT encoder (concurrent) provide additional benefits. The proposed models retain the strong effects of systems from the literature while also producing target-level fluency on average.

We show that polyglot training can result in better labeling accuracy than a monolingual parser, especially for low-resource languages. We find that even a simple combination of data is as effective as more complex kinds of polyglot training.

The extracted themes are: Police shootings, Islam and War, Supporting Trump, Black People, Civil Rights, Attacking Hillary, and Crimes. In some themes, like Supporting Trump and Attacking Hillary, we found contradicted opinions, in favor and against the main themes, but we chose the final stance based on the most representative hashtags and words in each of them (see Figure FIGREF11). Also, the themes Police Shooting and Crimes are similar, but we found that some words such as: police, officers, cops, shooting, gun, shot, etc. are the most discriminative between these two themes. In addition, we found that the Crimes theme focuses more on raping crimes against children and women.

This can especially be seen in scientific articles where the analysis is carried out on a few hundred reviews only. It is worth mentioning that this task is extremely problematic because of the huge diversity of languages and the difficulty of building a single solution that can cover all the languages used in the world. Natural language analysis often requires additional pre-processing steps, especially at the stage of preparing the data for analysis, and steps specific for each language.

We consider events for which a person is the subject (e.g, \u201cPersonX listens to PersonX's music\u201d) to be human activities, and remove the rest (e.g., \u201cIt is Christmas morning\u201d). We then use several simple rules to convert the Event2Mind instances into first-person past-tense activities. Since all events were already filtered so that they begin with \u201cPersonX\u201d, we replace the first occurrence of \u201cPersonX\u201d in each event with \u201cI\u201d and all subsequent occurrences with \u201cme\u201d.

BLSTM outperforms the LSTM variant in all the tasks except `Content', which signifies the power of using the information flowing from both the directions of the tweet. T2V which is expected to perform well in this task because of its ability to work at a more fine level (i.e., characters) performs the worst. In fact T2V does not outperform other models in any task, which could be mainly due to the fact that the hashtags which are used for supervision in learning tweet representations reduces the generalization capability of the tweets beyond hashtag prediction. Prediction tasks such as `Content' and `Hashtag' seem to be less difficult as all the models perform nearly optimal for them. The superior performance of all the models for the `Content' task in particular is unlike the relatively lower performance reported for in [5], mainly because of the short length of the tweets. The most surprising result is when the BOM model turned out to be the best in `Word Order' task, as the model by nature loses the word order.

We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model.

The empirical evaluation results suggest that the CNN-based model has an advantage on the humor recognition task. In addition, focusing on the system development time, generating and implementing those features in the conventional model would take days or even weeks. However, the CNN model automatically learns its optimal feature representation and can adjust the features automatically across data sets. This makes the CNN model quite versatile for supporting different tasks and data domains.

Opinion summarization is the task of automatically generating summaries for a set of opinions about a specific target BIBREF0. Figure FIGREF1 shows various reviews about the movie \u201cCoach Carter\u201d and example summaries generated by humans and automatic systems. The vast majority of previous work BIBREF1 views opinion summarization as the final stage of a three-step process involving: (1) aspect extraction (i.e., finding features pertaining to the target of interest, such as battery life or sound quality); (2) sentiment prediction (i.e., determining the sentiment of the extracted aspects); and (3) summary generation (i.e., presenting the identified opinions to the user). Textual summaries are created following mostly extractive methods which select representative segments (usually sentences) from the source text BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. Despite being less popular, abstractive approaches seem more appropriate for the task at hand as they attempt to generate summaries which are maximally informative and minimally redundant without simply rearranging passages from the original opinions BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. General-purpose summarization approaches have recently shown promising results with end-to-end models which are data-driven and take advantage of the success of sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures. Most approaches BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13 encode documents and then decode the learned representations into an abstractive summary, often by attending to the source input BIBREF14 and copying words from it BIBREF15. Under this modeling paradigm, it is no longer necessary to identify aspects and their sentiment for the opinion summarization task, as these are learned indirectly from training data (i.e., sets of opinions and their corresponding summaries). These models are usually tested on domains where the input is either one document or a small set of documents. However, the number of opinions tends to be very large (150 for the example in Figure FIGREF1). It is therefore practically unfeasible to train a model in an end-to-end fashion, given the memory limitations of modern hardware. As a result, current approaches BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19 sacrifice end-to-end elegance in favor of a two-stage framework which we call Extract-Abstract: an extractive model first selects a subset of opinions and an abstractive model then generates the summary while conditioning on the extracted subset (see Figure FIGREF5). The extractive pass unfortunately has two drawbacks. Firstly, on account of having access to a subset of opinions, the summaries can be less informative and inaccurate, as shown in Figure FIGREF1. And secondly, user preferences cannot be easily taken into account (e.g., the reader may wish to obtain a summary focusing on the acting or plot of a movie as opposed to a general-purpose summary) since more specialized information might have been removed."]}

A major limitation is that the re-ranking algorithm cannot choose answer candidates beyond the top-10 results. It would be interesting to classify whether an answer is present in the top-10 or not. If not, the algorithm could search outside the top-10 results. Such a meta-model can also be used to estimate weaknesses of the QA model: it can determine topics that regularly fail, for instance, to guide data labelling for a targeted improvement of the model, also known as active learning BIBREF27 , and in combination with techniques from semi-supervised learning BIBREF5 , BIBREF28 ."]}

At the time of writing, at least four of these datasets contain more than one billion triples each. This huge amount of available data has become a fertile ground for Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms. Today, applications of machine-learning techniques comprise a broad variety of research areas related to Linked Data, such as Link Discovery, Named Entity Recognition, and Structured Question Answering. The field of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) has emerged in the Machine Learning community during the last five years. The underlying concept of KGE is that in a knowledge base, each entity and relation can be regarded as a vector in a continuous space. The generated vector representations can be used by algorithms employing machine learning, deep learning, or statistical relational learning to accomplish a given task. Several KGE approaches have already shown promising results on tasks such as link prediction, entity recommendation, question answering, and triplet classification BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . Moreover, Distributional Semantics techniques (e.g., Word2Vec or Doc2Vec) are relatively new in the Semantic Web community. The RDF2Vec approaches BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 are examples of pioneering research and to date, they represent the only option for learning embeddings on a large knowledge graph without the need for state-of-the-art hardware. To this end, we devise the KG2Vec approach, which comprises skip-gram techniques for creating embeddings on large knowledge graphs in a feasible time but still maintaining the quality of state-of-the-art embeddings. Our evaluation shows that KG2Vec achieves a vector quality comparable to the most scalable approaches and can process more than 250 million triples in less than 7 hours on a machine with suboptimal performances."]}

A better approach, which was not beyond the thinking of the group since it was already proposed by Matkovi\u0107 in his dissertation from 1957 BIBREF20, would be to use word bigrams and align them. It is worth mentioning that, although the idea of machine translation in the 1950s in Croatia did not have a significant influence on development of the field, it shows that Croatian linguists had contemporary views and necessary competencies for its development. But, unfortunately, the development of machine translation in Croatia had been stopped because of the previously discussed circumstances. In 1964, Laszlo went to the USA, where he spent the next seven years, and after returning to Croatia, he was active as a university professor, but because of disagreement with the ruling political option regarding Croatian language issues, he published very rarely and was mainly focused on other linguistic issues in that period, but his work was a major influence on the later development of computational linguistics in Croatia."]}

So A would get 101, while F would get 11010011 BIBREF11. Building on that, Laszlo suggested that, when making an efficient machine translation system, one has to take into account not just the letter frequencies but also the redundancies of some of the letters in a word BIBREF16. This suggests that the strategy would be as follows: first make a thesaurus, and pick a representative for each meaning, then stem or lemmatize the words, then remove the needless letters from words (i.e. letters that carry little information, such as vowels, but being careful not to equate two different words), and then encode the words in binary strings, using the letter frequencies.

The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8.

In this paper, we present a new method for emotion cause extraction. We consider emotion cause extraction as a question answering (QA) task. Given a text containing the description of an event which [id=lq]may or may not cause a certain emotion, we take [id=lq]an emotion word [id=lq]in context, such as \u201csad\u201d, as a query. The question to the QA system is: \u201cDoes the described event cause the emotion of sadness?\u201d. The [id=lq]expected answer [id=lq]is either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. (see Figure FIGREF1 ). We build our QA system based on a deep memory network. The memory network has two inputs: a piece of text, [id=lq]referred to as a story in QA systems, and a query.

Nevertheless, the shared space usually mixes some task-relevant features, which makes the learning of different tasks introduce noise. To address this issue, Liu et al. BIBREF29 explore an adversarial shared-private model to alleviate the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with each other. However, these models transmit all shared features in the shared layer to related tasks without distillation, which disturb specific tasks due to some useless and even harmful shared features.

Those papers used different objectives to encourage learning disentangled representations. BIBREF9 used pre-trained classifiers as the supervision. BIBREF10 used a GAN-based approach in which binary classifiers were used as discriminators.

During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all word categories of LIWC corresponding to affective processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC. For example, the affective representation of the sentence i will fight in the war is $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}=$ {\u201csad\":0, \u201cangry\":1, \u201canxiety\":0, \u201cnegative emotion\":1, \u201cpositive emotion\":0}."]}

The resource is made by combining different wordnets together, knowledge from Wiktionary and the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. Overall they obtained over 2 million senses for over 100 thousand concepts, linking over 1.4 million words in hundreds of languages. Since using existing lexical resources guarantees a high precision, it may also provide a low recall due to the limitedness of lexical resources in different languages and domains. A different approach to expand English WordNet synsets with lexicalizations in other languages was proposed in BIBREF51 . The authors do not directly match concepts in the two different language resources, but demonstrate an approach that learns how to determine the best translation for English synsets by taking bilingual dictionaries, structural information of the English WordNet and corpus frequency information into account. With the growing amount of parallel data, BIBREF52 show an approach to acquire a set of synsets from parallel corpora. The synsets are obtained by comparing aligned words in parallel corpora in several languages. Similarly, the sloWNet for Slovene BIBREF53 and Wolf for French BIBREF12 are constructed using a multilingual corpus and word alignment techniques in combination with other existing lexical resources. Since all these approaches use word alignment information, they are not able to generate any translation equivalents for multi-word expressions (MWE). In contrast, our approach use an SMT system trained on a large amount of parallel sentences, which allows us to align possible MWEs, such as commercial loan or take a breath, between source and target language. Furthermore, we engage the idea of identifying relevant contextual information to support an SMT system translating short expressions, which showed better performance compared to approaches without a context. BIBREF54 built small domain-specific translation models for ontology translation from relevant sentence pairs that were identified in a parallel corpus based on the ontology labels to be translated. With this approach they improve the translation quality over the usage of large generic translation models. Since the generation of translation models can be computational expensive, BIBREF55 use large generic translation models to translate ontology labels, which were placed into a disambiguated context. With this approach the authors demonstrate translation quality improvement over commercial systems, like Microsoft Translator. Different from this approach, which uses the hierarchical structure of the ontology for disambiguation, we engage a large number of different languages to identify the relevant context."]}

We believe that this is due two factors. First, we presented the sentences in a scrambled order and asked for an absolute grammaticality judgment. It may be more difficult to put a sentence on a 1 to 10 scale than making pairwise judgments. Second, our sentences may be particularly challenging. The grammatical sentences contained both unusual argument orders and semantically odd situations, thus inciting participants to rate them low. While these factors could be expected to impact the LSTM, it is more surprising that they impact humans, despite precise instructions to rate on grammaticality rather than meaning or frequency. In addition, as can be seen in Figure FIGREF11b, some ungrammatical sentences were rated as highly grammatical by humans. We suspect that these are cases of inattention, as in our test set the distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical rest on a single word, and even a single character (the distinction between 'der' and 'den', for instance)."]}

While humans tend to give similar scores for each violation type, models tend to assign higher log probability scores to sentences with doubled nominatives than to grammatical sentences, leading to worse than chance performance on Nominative violations. Conversely, models tend to assign lower log probability scores to sentences with doubled datives, likely because these sentences lack either a nominative or an accusative, both of which are more frequent than dative. This leads to better than human performance on this case violation. Such behavior is probably due to the fact that German being a non pro-drop language, every verb must have a nominative case, making nominative more frequent than accusative, and that dative even rarer. This frequency bias is worse for models that are directly based on frequency, such as our unigram and bigram models. However, our LSTM is not exempt from it, confirming that RNNs rely in part on frequency cues."]}

Finally, we hope this work can serve as a baseline for future research on unsupervised acoustic unit discovery in very low resource scenarios."]}

A new variant of CDA we propose (the Names Intervention) is the only to successfully mitigate indirect gender bias: following its application, previously biased words are significantly less clustered according to gender, with an average of 49% reduction in cluster purity when clustering the most biased words.

A mapping between nicknames (not covered by administrative sources) and formal names could be learned from a corpus for even wider coverage, possibly via the intermediary of coreference chains. Finally, given that names have been used in psychological literature as a proxy for race (e.g. BIBREF12), the Names Intervention could also be used to mitigate racial biases (something which, to the authors' best knowledge, has never been attempted), but finding pairings could prove problematic.

Like SpecAugment, this approach masks out partial of the acoustic features during model training. However, instead of using a random mask as in SpecAugment, our approach masks out the whole patch of the features corresponding to an output token during training, e.g., a word or a word-piece.

Thus we can conclude that there seem to be a trade-off between scalability and prediction quality, as while the occupation dataset provided the best results, it seems unlikely to be subject to any upscaling due to the high cost of obtaining a clean dataset. Relying on location to estimate SES seems to be more likely to benefit from such an approach, though at the cost of an increased number of mislabelled users in the dataset. Moreover, the annotator's estimation of SES using Street View at each home location seems to be hindered by the large variability of urban features. Note that even though inter-agreement is 76%, the Cohen's kappa score for annotator inter-agreement is low at 0.169.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of female workers with the frequency of female translations, finding no correlation between said variables. Our data shows that Google Translate outputs fail to reflect the real-world distribution of female workers, under-estimating the expected frequency. That is to say that even if we do not expect a 50:50 distribution of translated gender pronouns, Google Translate exhibits male defaults in a greater frequency that job occupation data alone would suggest.

In this paper, we suggest that and test the hypothesis that statistical translation tools can be probed to yield insights about stereotypical gender roles in our society \u2013 or at least in their training data. By translating professional-related sentences such as \u201cHe/She is an engineer\u201d from gender neutral languages such as Hungarian and Chinese into English, we were able to collect statistics about the asymmetry between female and male pronominal genders in the translation outputs. Our results show that male defaults are not only prominent, but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) occupations. And because Google Translate typically uses English as a lingua franca to translate between other languages (e.g. Chinese INLINEFORM0 English INLINEFORM1 Portuguese) BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 , our findings possibly extend to translations between gender neutral languages and non-gender neutral languages (apart from English) in general, although we have not tested this hypothesis."]}

Specifically, we can translate sentences such as the Hungarian \u201c\u0151 egy \u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d, where \u201c\u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d translates to \u201cnurse\u201d and \u201c\u0151\u201d is a gender-neutral pronoun meaning either he, she or it, to English, yielding in this example the result \u201cshe's a nurse\u201d on Google Translate. As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when \u201cnurse\u201d is replaced by \u201cengineer\u201d. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions \u2013 which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias \u2013, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( \u201cComputer occupations, all other\u201d, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (\u201chost/hostess\u201d, \u201cwaiter/waitress\u201d). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 . We made all code and data used to generate and compile the results presented in the following sections publicly available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/marceloprates/Gender-Bias.

This can be circumvented by indexing and searching on other large sources of information, such as Common Crawl and Flickr. However, maintaining a large source of images would be an issue, e.g. the Flickr dataset may not be comprehensive enough (i.e. tokens may not return results). This will be a subject of future work. Besides, an important step in the pre-processing is the classification of part-of-speech tags. In the Ritter dataset our current error propagation is 0.09 (107 tokens which should be classified as NOUN) using NLTK 3.0. Despite good performance (91% accuracy), we plan to benchmark this component. In terms of processing time, the bottleneck of the current implementation is the time required to extract features from images, as expected. Currently we achieve a performance of 3~5 seconds per sentence and plan to also optimize this component. The major advantages of this approach are: 1) the fact that there are no hand-crafted rules encoded; 2) the ability to handle misspelled words (because the search engine alleviates that and returns relevant or related information) and incomplete sentences; 3) the generic design of its components, allowing multilingual processing with little effort (the only dependency is the POS tagger) and straightforward extension to support more NER classes (requiring a corpus of images and text associated to each desired NER class, which can be obtained from a Knowledge Base, such as DBpedia, and an image dataset, such as METU dataset). While initial results in a gold standard dataset showed the potential of the approach, we also plan to integrate these outcomes into a Sequence Labeling (SL) system, including neural architectures such as LSTM, which are more suitable for such tasks as NER or POS.

However, encoder\u2019s contextual representations are uncertain when dealing with long-range dependencies. To address these drawbacks, Vaswani et al. in BIBREF80 introduced a novel network architecture, called Transformer, relying entirely on self-attention units to map input sequences to output sequences without the use of RNNs. The Transformer\u2019s decoder unit architecture contains a masked multi-head attention layer followed by a multi-head attention unit and a feed forward network whereas the decoder unit is almost identical without the masked attention unit. Multi-head self-attention layers are calculated in parallel facing the computational costs of regular attention layers used by previous seq2seq network architectures. In BIBREF18 the authors presented a model that is founded on findings from various previous studies (e.g., BIBREF83, BIBREF84, BIBREF64, BIBREF49, BIBREF80), which achieved state-of-the-art results on eleven NLP tasks, called BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The BERT training process is split in two phases, the unsupervised pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase using labelled data for down-streaming tasks. In contrast with previous proposed models (e.g., BIBREF64, BIBREF49), BERT uses masked language models (MLMs) to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. In the pre-training phase the model is trained with a large amount of unlabeled data from Wikipedia, BookCorpus BIBREF85 and WordPiece BIBREF86 embeddings. In this training part, the model was tested on two tasks; on the first task, the model randomly masks 15% of the input tokens aiming to capture conceptual representations of word sequences by predicting masked words inside the corpus, whereas in the second task the model is given two sentences and tries to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence of the first. In the second phase, BERT is extended with a task-related classifier model that is trained on a supervised manner. During this supervised phase, the pre-trained BERT model receives minimal changes, with the classifier\u2019s parameters trained in order to minimize the loss function. Two models presented in BIBREF18, a \u201cBase Bert\u201d model with 12 encoder layers (i.e. transformer blocks), feed-forward networks with 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads, and a \u201cLarge Bert\u201d model with 24 encoder layers 1024 feed-the pre-trained Bert model, an architecture almost identical with the aforementioned Transformer network. A [CLS] token is supplied in the input as the first token, the final hidden state of which is aggregated for classification tasks. Despite the achieved breakthroughs, the BERT model suffers from several drawbacks. Firstly, BERT, as all language models using Transformers, assumes (and pre-supposes) independence between the masked words from the input sequence, and neglects all the positional and dependency information between words. In other words, for the prediction of a masked token both word and position embeddings are masked out, even if positional information is a key-aspect of NLP BIBREF87. In addition, the [MASK] token which, is substituted with masked words, is mostly absent in fine-tuning phase for down-streaming tasks, leading to a pre-training fine-turning discrepancy. To address the cons of BERT, a permutation language model was introduced, so-called XLnet, trained to predict masked tokens in a non-sequential random order, factorizing likelihood in an autoregressive manner without the independence assumption and without relying on any input corruption BIBREF88. In particular, a query stream is used that extends embedding representations to incorporate positional information about the masked words. The original representation set (content stream), including both token and positional embeddings, is then used as input to the query stream following a scheme called \u201cTwo-Stream SelfAttention\u201d. To overcome the problem of slow convergence the authors propose the prediction of the last token in the permutation phase, instead of predicting the entire sequence. Finally, XLnet uses also a special token for the classification and separation of the input sequence, [CLS] and [SEP] respectively, however it also learns an embedding that denotes whether the two words are from the same segment. This is similar to relative positional encodings introduced in TrasformerXL BIBREF87, and extents the ability of XLnet to cope with tasks that encompass arbitrary input segments. Recently, a replication study, BIBREF18, suggested several modifications in the training procedure of BERT which, outperforms the original XLNet architecture on several NLP tasks. The optimized model, called Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), used 10 times more data (160GB compared with the 16GB originally exploited), and is trained with far more epochs than the BERT model (500K vs 100K), using also 8-times larger batch sizes, and a byte-level BPE vocabulary instead of the character-level vocabulary that was previously utilized. Another significant modification, was the dynamic masking technique instead of the single static mask used in BERT. In addition, RoBERTa model removes the next sentence prediction objective used in BERT, following advises by several other studies that question the NSP loss term BIBREF89, BIBREF90, BIBREF91."]}

Since the release of second version of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), which is over the 1 million word Wall Street Journal corpus, analyzing the PDTB-2.0 is very useful for further study on shallow discourse parsing. Prasad et al. PrasadDLMRJW08 describe lexically-grounded annotations of discourse relations in PDTB. Identifying the discourse connective from ordinary words accurately is not easy because discourse words can have discourse or non-discourse usage. Pitler and Nenkova PitlerN09 use syntax feature to disambiguate explicit discourse connective in text and prove that the syntactic features can improve performance in disambiguation task. After identifying the discourse connective, there is a need to find the arguments. There are some different methods to find the arguments. Ziheng Lin et al. LinNK14 first identify the locations of Arg1, and choose sentence from prior candidate sentence if the location is before the connective. Otherwise, label arguments span by choosing the high node in the parse tree. Wellner and Pustejovsky WellnerP07 focus on identifying rela-tions between the pairs of head words. Based on such thinking, Robert Elwell and Jason Baldridge ElwellB08 improve the performance using connective specific rankers, which differentiate between specific connectives and types of connectives. Ziheng Lin et al. LinNK14 present an implicit discourse relation classifier based the Penn Discourse Treebank. All of these efforts can be viewed as the part of the full parser. More and more researcher has been devoted to the subtask of the shallow discourse parsing, like dis-ambiguating discourse connective BIBREF8 , finding implicit relation BIBREF9 . There is a need to pull these subtasks together to achieve more efforts. So in this paper, we develop a full shallow discourse parser based on the maximum entropy model using abundant features. Our parser attempts to identify connective, arguments of discourse connec-tive and the relation into right sense."]}

It is possible that the additional NTM module was too difficult to train, or that the NTM module injected noise into the input of the GRU such that training became difficult. It is still surprising that the NTM was not put to better use, for performance gains. It is possible the model has not been appropriately tuned."]}

Such an approach using two counters was used in proofs in [6], [8] to establish that RNNs with arbitrary precision can emulate Turing machines. We believe that an approach related to this fact could ultimately prove successful, but it would be more useful if set up as in the proofs above in a way that is faithful to the architecture of the neural networks. Counter automata of this sort are also quite unlike the usual implementations found for context-free languages or their extensions for natural languages.

This means that, based on the cosine similarity scores - the networks edge weights, the algorithm clusters similar sentences together in a same community while the algorithm proceeds maximizing the connectivity strength amongst the nodes in each community. The network constructed with no threshold in place was detected to have 18 distinct communities with three single node communities. Based on the visualized network (see Figure.FIGREF13), it seemed that the network community detection method clustered the sentence network as good as the original data set with human labeled classes although the communities do not look quite distinct.

Two directions of work that try to solve these tasks are: purely data-oriented and purely knowledge-oriented approaches. The data-oriented approaches generally propose to pre-train language models on large linguistic corpora, such that the model would implicitly acquire \u201ccommonsense\u201d through its statistical observations. Indeed, large pre-trained language models have achieved promising performance on many commonsense reasoning benchmarks BIBREF29, BIBREF30, BIBREF31, BIBREF32. The main downsides of this approach are that models are difficult to interpret and that they lack mechanisms for incorporating explicit commonsense knowledge. Conversely, purely knowledge-oriented approaches combine structured knowledge bases and perform symbolic reasoning, on the basis of axiomatic principles. Such models enjoy the property of interpretability, but often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference, based on real-world observations. Hybrid models are those that attempt to fuse these two approaches, by extracting knowledge from structured knowledge bases and using the resulting information to guide the learning paradigm of statistical estimators, such as deep neural network models."]}

Because YouTube transcripts have timing information, we are able to line up each action with its corresponding frames in the video. We sometimes notice a gap of several seconds between the time an action occurs in the transcript and the time it is shown in the video. To address this misalignment, we first map the actions to the miniclips using the time information from the transcript.

This finding proves that our partial decoding model is able to generate accurate translation by anticipating the future content. It also indicates that the anticipation based on a larger context presents more robust performance than the aggressive anticipation in the wait-k model, as well as in the segment based decoding model."]}

The schema defines the input, output, and coarse-grained data flow of a deep learning model. Informally, the schema defines what the model computes but not how the model computes it: Overton does not prescribe architectural details of the underlying model (e.g., Overton is free to embed sentences using an LSTM or a Transformer) or hyperparameters, like hidden state size.

We present a simple process to extract maximum useful information from the image.

Although, this similarity is what helps when classifying using the KNN model. For the single user data used, we see that the 338 images are classified as food images. It is observed that Italian and Mexican are the most preferred cuisines. It is also seen that as K value increases, the number of food images classified into Italian increases significantly.

However, when using BPE both ReWE and ReWE+ReSE have performed slightly below the baseline ($-0.37$ and $-0.12$ points BLEU pp, respectively).
