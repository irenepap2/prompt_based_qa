Most existing works focus on knowledge distillation. For instance, BERT-PKD BIBREF33 is a patient knowledge distillation approach that compresses the original BERT model into a lightweight shallow network. Different from traditional knowledge distillation methods, BERT-PKD enables an exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden layers by utilizing a layer-wise distillation constraint. DistillBERT BIBREF2 pre-trains a smaller general-purpose language model on the same corpus as vanilla BERT. Distilled BiLSTM BIBREF34 adopts a single-layer BiLSTM as the student model and achieves comparable results with ELMo BIBREF35 through much fewer parameters and less inference time. TinyBERT BIBREF3 reports the best-ever performance on BERT model compression, which exploits a novel attention-based distillation schema that encourages the linguistic knowledge in teacher to be well transferred into the student model. It adopts a two-stage learning framework, including general distillation (pre-training from scratch via distillation loss) and task-specific distillation with data augmentation. Both procedures require huge resources and long training times (from several days to weeks), which is cumbersome for industrial applications. Therefore, we are aiming to explore more lightweight solutions in this paper.", "To improve the performance of model compression, there are many attempts to conduct hybrid model compression method that combines more than one category of algorithms. Han et al. BIBREF27 combined quantization, hamming coding and weight pruning to conduct model compression on image classification tasks. Yu et al. BIBREF28 proposed a unified framework for low-rank and sparse decomposition of weight matrices with feature map reconstructions. Polino et al. BIBREF29 advocated a combination of distillation and quantization techniques and proposed two hybrid models, i.e., quantified distillation and differentiable quantization to address this problem. Li et al., BIBREF30 compressed DNN-based acoustic model through knowledge distillation and pruning. NNCF BIBREF31 provided a neural network compression framework that supported an integration of various model compression methods to generate more lightweight networks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in terms of a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In BIBREF32, an AutoML pipeline was adopted for model compression.

Specifically, we see the importance of using GloVe as pre-trained word embeddings, how word dropout improves generalization, and how context size plays an important role in the final classification result (showing one of our experiments).", "From the results of Table TABREF19 , we notice our single WSD network, despite eliminating the problem of having a large number of WSD classifiers, still falls short when is compared with the state-of-the-art WSD algorithms. Based on our intuition and supported by some of our preliminary experiments, this deficiency stems from an important factor in our BLSTM network. Since no sense embedding is made publicly available for use, the sense embeddings are initialized randomly; yet, word embeddings are initialized by pre-trained GloVe vectors in order to benefit from the semantic and syntactic properties of the context words conveyed by these embeddings. That is to say, the separate spaces that the sense embeddings and the (context) word embeddings come from enforces some delay for the alignment of these spaces which in turn demands more training data. Furthermore, this early misalignment does not allow the BLSTM fully take advantage of larger context sizes which can be helpful. Our first attempt to deal with such problem was to pre-train the sense embeddings by some techniques - such as taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) definition content words of senses, or taking the average of the GloVe embeddings of the (informative) context words in their training samples - did not give us a better result than our random initialization. Our preliminary experiments though in which we replaced all GloVe embeddings in the network with sense embeddings (using a method proposed by Chen et al. BIBREF11 ), showed considerable improvements in the results of some ambiguous words. That means both senses and context words (while they can be ambiguous by themselves) come from one vector space. In other words, the context would also be represented by the possible senses that its words can take. This idea not only can help to improve the results of the current model, it can also avoid the need for a large amount of training data since senses can be seen in both places, center and context, to be trained."]}

These indicators are generally extracted from other datasets used to complete the Twitter one, namely census data BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF17 or real estate online services as Zillow.com BIBREF18 . Other approaches have also relied on sources of socioeconomic information such as the UK Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) hierarchy, to assign socioeconomic status to users with occupation mentions BIBREF19 .

We defined socioeconomic classes by segmenting $C(S^u_\\mathrm {inc})$ such that the sum of income is the same for each classes (for an illustration of our method see Fig. 6 a in the Appendix). We constructed a social network by considering mutual mention links between these users (as introduced in Section \"Data Description\" ). Taking the assigned socioeconomic classes of connected individuals, we confirmed the effects of status homophily in the Twitter mention network by computing the connection matrix of socioeconomic groups normalized by the equivalent matrix of corresponding configuration model networks, which conserved all network properties except structural correlations (as explained in the Appendix).

We demonstrate that the resultant binary paragraph vectors significantly outperform semantic hashing codes. We also evaluate binary paragraph vectors in transfer learning settings, where training and inference are carried out on unrelated text corpora. Finally, we study models that simultaneously learn short binary codes for document filtering and longer, real-valued representations for ranking.

One solution could be to train the model with a big generic text corpus, that covers a wide variety of domains.

To shed light on this question we trained Binary PV-DBOW with bigrams on the English Wikipedia, and then inferred binary codes for the test parts of the 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets. The results are presented in Table TABREF14 and in Figure FIGREF11 . The model trained on an unrelated text corpus gives lower retrieval precision than models with domain-specific training sets, which is not surprising.

Furthermore, Binary PV-DBOW with bigrams outperforms semantic hashing codes: comparison of precision-recall curves from Figures FIGREF7 a and FIGREF7 b with BIBREF3 shows that 128-bit codes learned with this model outperform 128-bit semantic hashing codes on 20 Newsgroups and RCV1. Moreover, the 32-bit codes from this model outperform 128-bit semantic hashing codes on the RCV1 dataset, and on the 20 Newsgroups dataset give similar precision up to approximately 3% recall and better precision for higher recall levels.

BERT is a method for pre-training language representations, meaning that it is pre-trained on a large text corpus and then used for downstream NLP tasks. Word2Vec BIBREF9 showed that we can use vectors to properly represent words in a way that captures semantic or meaning-related relationships. While Word2Vec is a context-free model that generates a single word-embedding for each word in the vocabulary, BERT generates a representation of each word that is based on the other words in the sentence. It was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations, such as ELMo BIBREF10 and ULMFit BIBREF11, and is deeply bidirectional, representing each word using both its left and right context. We use the pre-trained models of BERT and fine-tune it on the dataset of fake news and satire articles using Adam optimizer with 3 types of decay and 0.01 decay rate. Our BERT-based binary classifier is created by adding a single new layer in BERT's neural network architecture that will be trained to fine-tune BERT to our task of classifying fake news and satire articles."]}

This performance is also attested by relatively strong numbers on the other metrics as well. Prices-only, which does not incorporate any knowledge from natural language, fails to beat the average baseline even with $60\\%$ of the negotiation history. This can be attributed to the observation that in many negotiations, before discussing the price, buyers tend to get more information about the product by exchanging messages: what is the condition of the product, how old it is, is there an urgency for any of the buyer/seller and so on. Incorporating natural language in both the scenario and event messages paves the way to leverage such cues and make better predictions early on in the conversation, as depicted in the plots. Both BERT and BERT-GRU consistently perform well on the complete test set. There is no clear winner, although using a recurrent network proves to be more helpful in the early stages of the negotiation.

The gap between each edit distance groups, i.e. (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), is obvious. This means that INLINEFORM0 learned from English can successfully encode the sequential phonetic structures into fixed-length vector for the target languages to some good extend even though it has never seen any audio data of the target languages. Another interesting fact is the corresponding variance between languages. In the source language, English, the variances of the five edit distance groups are fixed at 0.030, which means that the cosine similarity in each edit distance group is centralized. However, the variances of the groups in the target languages vary. In French and German, the variance grows from 0.030 to 0.060 as the edit distance increases from 0 to 4. For Czech/Spanish, the variance starts at a larger value of 0.040/0.050 and increases to 0.050/0.073. We suspect that the fluctuating variance is related to the similarity between languages. English, German and French are more similar compared with Czech and Spanish.

Back to Fig. FIGREF14 , the gap between phoneme sequence edit distances 2 and 3 in Spanish is smaller than other languages.

Furthermore, we show that using infinite edge weights and a non-standard output function, GRUs are also at least as powerful as PDAs.", "Because to the our knowledge there is no analogue of the Chomsky-Sch INLINEFORM0 tzenberger Theorem for Turing recognizable languages, it seems difficult to directly extend our methods to prove that recurrent architectures are as computationally powerful as Turing machines. However, just as PDAs can lazily be described as a DFA with an associated stack, it is well-known that Turing machines are equally as powerful as DFAs with associated queues, which can be simulated with two stacks. Such an approach using two counters was used in proofs in [6], [8] to establish that RNNs with arbitrary precision can emulate Turing machines. We believe that an approach related to this fact could ultimately prove successful, but it would be more useful if set up as in the proofs above in a way that is faithful to the architecture of the neural networks. Counter automata of this sort are also quite unlike the usual implementations found for context-free languages or their extensions for natural languages. Work described in [10] demonstrates that in practice, LSTMs cannot really generalize to recognize the Dyck language INLINEFORM1 . It remains to investigate whether any recent neural network variation does in fact readily generalize outside its training set to \u201cout of sample\u201d examples. This would be an additional topic for future research.", "If we remove the finite precision restriction, we again wish to prove that Gated RNNs are as powerful as PDAs. To do so, we emulate the approach from Section 1. Immediately we encounter difficulties - in particular, our previous approach relied on maintaining the digits of a state INLINEFORM0 in base INLINEFORM1 very carefully. With outputs now run through sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions, this becomes very hard. Furthermore, updating the state INLINEFORM2 occasionally requires multiplication by INLINEFORM3 (when we read a closing parenthesis). But because INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 for all INLINEFORM6 , this is impossible to do with the GRU architecture."]}

In this paper, we describe briefly the whole workflow and present a prototype implementation. Currently, existing solutions for sentiment annotation offer mostly analysis on the level of entire documents, and if you go deeper to the level of individual product features, they are only superficial and poorly prepared for the analysis of large volumes of data. This can especially be seen in scientific articles where the analysis is carried out on a few hundred reviews only. It is worth mentioning that this task is extremely problematic because of the huge diversity of languages and the difficulty of building a single solution that can cover all the languages used in the world. Natural language analysis often requires additional pre-processing steps, especially at the stage of preparing the data for analysis, and steps specific for each language. Large differences can be seen in the analysis of the Polish language (a highly inflected language) and English (a grammatically simpler one). We propose a solution that will cover several languages, however in this prototype implementation we focused on English texts only.", "A sentiment analysis can be made at the level of (1) the whole document, (2) the individual sentences, or (what is currently seen as the most attractive approach) (3) at the level of individual fragments of text. Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .", "Modern society is an information society bombarded from all sides by an increasing number of different pieces of information. The 21st century has brought us the rapid development of media, especially in the internet ecosystem. This change has caused the transfer of many areas of our lives to virtual reality.

Specifically, we can translate sentences such as the Hungarian \u201c\u0151 egy \u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d, where \u201c\u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d translates to \u201cnurse\u201d and \u201c\u0151\u201d is a gender-neutral pronoun meaning either he, she or it, to English, yielding in this example the result \u201cshe's a nurse\u201d on Google Translate. As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when \u201cnurse\u201d is replaced by \u201cengineer\u201d. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions \u2013 which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias \u2013, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( \u201cComputer occupations, all other\u201d, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (\u201chost/hostess\u201d, \u201cwaiter/waitress\u201d). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 . We made all code and data used to generate and compile the results presented in the following sections publicly available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/marceloprates/Gender-Bias.

One could ask a question, if it is possible to use binary paragraph vectors without collecting a domain-specific training set? For example, what if we needed to hash documents that are not associated with any available domain-specific corpus? One solution could be to train the model with a big generic text corpus, that covers a wide variety of domains. BIBREF21 evaluated this approach for real-valued paragraph vectors, with promising results. It is not obvious, however, whether short binary codes would also perform well in similar settings. To shed light on this question we trained Binary PV-DBOW with bigrams on the English Wikipedia, and then inferred binary codes for the test parts of the 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets. The results are presented in Table TABREF14 and in Figure FIGREF11 . The model trained on an unrelated text corpus gives lower retrieval precision than models with domain-specific training sets, which is not surprising. However, it still performs remarkably well, indicating that the semantics it captured can be useful for different text collections. Importantly, these results were obtained without domain-specific finetuning.", "The 20 Newsgroups dataset comes with reference train/test sets. In case of RCV1 we used half of the documents for training and the other half for evaluation. In case of English Wikipedia we held out for testing randomly selected 10% of the documents. We perform document retrieval by selecting queries from the test set and ordering other test documents according to the similarity of the inferred codes. We use Hamming distance for binary codes and cosine similarity for real-valued representations. Results are averaged over queries. We assess the performance of our models with precision-recall curves and two popular information retrieval metrics, namely mean average precision (MAP) and the normalized discounted cumulative gain at the 10th result (NDCG@10) BIBREF16 . The results depend, of course, on the chosen document relevancy measure. Relevancy measure for the 20 Newsgroups dataset is straightforward: a retrieved document is relevant to the query if they both belong to the same newsgroup. In RCV1 each document belongs to a hierarchy of topics, making the definition of relevancy less obvious. In this case we adopted the relevancy measure used by BIBREF3 . That is, the relevancy is calculated as the fraction of overlapping labels in a retrieved document and the query document. Overall, our selection of test datasets and relevancy measures for 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 follows BIBREF3 , enabling comparison with semantic hashing codes. To assess the relevancy of articles in English Wikipedia we can employ categories assigned to them. However, unlike in RCV1, Wikipedia categories can have multiple parent categories and cyclic dependencies. Therefore, for this dataset we adopted a simplified relevancy measure: two articles are relevant if they share at least one category. We also removed from the test set categories with less than 20 documents as well as documents that were left with no categories. Overall, the relevancy is measured over more than INLINEFORM0 categories, making English Wikipedia harder than the other two benchmarks.", "To assess the performance of binary paragraph vectors, we carried out experiments on three datasets: 20 Newsgroups, a cleansed version (also called v2) of Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) and English Wikipedia. As paragraph vectors can be trained with relatively large vocabularies, we did not perform any stemming of the source text. However, we removed stop words as well as words shorter than two characters and longer than 15 characters. Results reported by BIBREF15 indicate that performance of PV-DBOW can be improved by including n-grams in the model. We therefore evaluated two variants of Binary PV-DBOW: one predicting words in documents and one predicting words and bigrams. Since 20 Newsgroups is a relatively small dataset, we used all words and bigrams from its documents. This amounts to a vocabulary with slightly over one million elements. For the RCV1 dataset we used words and bigrams with at least 10 occurrences in the text, which gives a vocabulary with approximately 800 thousands elements. In case of English Wikipedia we used words and bigrams with at least 100 occurrences, which gives a vocabulary with approximately 1.5 million elements."]}

This embedded tokens are provided as the input to the pre-trained BERT model for a full fine-tuning. The model gives an F1-score of $0.89$ for the concept recognition task. An 80-20 data split is used for training and evaluation. Detailed performance of the CR is shown in Table 2 and 3. Additionally, we also implemented CR using spaCy BIBREF18 which also produced similar results.", "Concept Recognition (CR) is a task identical to the traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem. A typical NER task seeks to identify entities like name of a person such as `Shakespeare', a geographical location such as `London', or name of an organisation such as `NASA' from unstructured text. A supervised NER dataset consists of the above mentioned entities annotated at the word-token level using labelling schemes such as BIO which provides beginning (B), continuation or inside (I), and outside (O) representation for each word of an entity. BIBREF8 is the current top-performing NER model for CoNLL-2003 shared task BIBREF9. Off-the-shelf named entity extractors do not suffice in the SE common-knowledge scenario because the entities we want to extract are domain-specific concepts such as `system architecture' or `functional requirements' rather than physical entities such as `Shakespeare' or `London'. This requires defining new labels and fine-tuning."]}

Also clustering tweets by keywords and subsequently judging rumours using an ensemble model that combine user, propagation and content-based features proved to be effective (Zhou et. al, 2015).

The approach with the lowest latency banks on the 'wisdom of the crowd' (Liu et. al, 2015). In addition to traditional context and user based features they also rely on clustering micro-blogs by their topicality to identify conflicting claims, which indicate increased likelihood of rumours.

Lexical features, however, had a strong discriminatory power without an increase in bias towards the majority classes. Using this subset of features only, we achieved approximately the same performance (0.8 F) as with the complete set of features, All (0.81 F). This suggests that lexical information alone can successfully distinguish the CEFR level of course book texts at the document level. Using the complete feature set we obtained 81% accuracy and 97% adjacent accuracy (when misclassifications to adjacent classes are considered correct).

Cross-entropy loss would be a convenient objective on which to train the model since ROUGE is not differentiable, but doing so would create a mismatch between metrics used for training and evaluation. Though a particular summary scores well on ROUGE evaluation comparable to the target summary, it will be assigned lower probability by a supervised model. To tackle this problem, we have used a self-critic policy gradient method BIBREF13 to train the models directly using the ROUGE score as a reward. In this paper, we propose an architecture that addresses the issues discussed above.", "BIBREF5 made such an earlier attempt by using Q-learning for single-and multi-document summarization. Later, BIBREF15 proposed a coarse-to-fine hierarchical attention model to select a salient sentence using sentence attention using REINFORCE BIBREF20 and feed it to the decoder. BIBREF6 used REINFORCE to rank sentences for extractive summarization. BIBREF4 proposed deep communicating agents that operate over small chunks of a document, which is learned using a self-critical BIBREF13 training approach consisting of intermediate rewards. BIBREF9 used a advantage actor-critic (A2C) method to extract sentences followed by a decoder to form abstractive summaries. Our model does not suffer from their limiting assumption that a summary sentence is an abstracted version of a single source sentence. BIBREF18 trained their intra-attention model using a self-critical policy gradient algorithm BIBREF13. Though an RL objective gives a high ROUGE score, the output summaries are not readable by humans. To mitigate this problem, BIBREF18 used a weighted sum of supervised learning loss and RL loss.", "When humans read a document, we organize it in terms of word semantics followed by sentence semantics and then document semantics. In a text summarization task, after reading a document, sentences that have similar meanings or continual information are grouped together and then expressed in words. Such a hierarchical model was first introduced by BIBREF16 for document classification and later explored unsuccessfully for text summarization BIBREF3. In this work, we propose to use a hierarchical model with improved NSE to take advantage of both augmented memory and also the hierarchical document representation. We use a separate memory for each sentence to represent all the words of a sentence and a document memory to represent all sentences. Word memory composes novel words, and document memory composes novel sentences in the encoding process that can be later used to extract highlights and decode to summaries as shown in Figure FIGREF17."]}
