We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal.", "In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task.

In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold)."]}

We use the term `common-knowledge' as the `commonsense' knowledge of a specific domain. This knowledge can be seen as a pivot that can be used later to collect `commonsense' knowledge for the SE domain.

The word vectors are obtained once the models are optimized. Usually, this optimizing process is done using stochastic gradient descent method.

No formal definition exists but there is a consensus that it is speech that targets disadvantaged social groups in a manner that is potentially harmful to them BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 .

In many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, there are laws prohibiting hate speech, which tends to be defined as speech that targets minority groups in a way that could promote violence or social disorder. People convicted of using hate speech can often face large fines and even imprisonment. These laws extend to the internet and social media, leading many sites to create their own provisions against hate speech. Both Facebook and Twitter have responded to criticism for not doing enough to prevent hate speech on their sites by instituting policies to prohibit the use of their platforms for attacks on people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, or threats of violence towards others.", "Drawing upon these definitions, we define hate speech as language that is used to expresses hatred towards a targeted group or is intended to be derogatory, to humiliate, or to insult the members of the group. In extreme cases this may also be language that threatens or incites violence, but limiting our definition only to such cases would exclude a large proportion of hate speech. Importantly, our definition does not include all instances of offensive language because people often use terms that are highly offensive to certain groups but in a qualitatively different manner. For example some African Americans often use the term n*gga in everyday language online BIBREF2 , people use terms like h*e and b*tch when quoting rap lyrics, and teenagers use homophobic slurs like f*g as they play video games. Such language is prevalent on social media BIBREF3 , making this boundary condition crucial for any usable hate speech detection system ."]}

Users were annotated broadly as \"bot\" if, in contrast to users annotated as \"non-bot,\" they do not appear to be posting personal information. Users were annotated as \"unavailable\" if their Twitter sites could not be viewed at the time of annotation, due to modifying their privacy settings or being removed or suspended from Twitter.

To adapt the Botometer scores to our binary classification task, we set the threshold to $0.47$, based on performing 5-fold cross validation over the training set. To further address the class imbalance, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)BIBREF24 to create artificial instances of \"bot\" users in the training set.

Social networks encapsulate large volumes of data associated with diverse health topics, generated by active user bases in continuous growth. Twitter, for example, has 330 million monthly active users worldwide that generate almost 500 million micro-blogs (tweets) per day. For some years, the use of the platform to share personal health information has been growing, particularly amongst people living with one or more chronic conditions and those living with disability. Twenty percent of social network site users living with chronic conditions gather and share health information on the sites, compared with 12% of social network site users who report no chronic conditions. Social media data is thus being widely used for health-related research, for tasks such as adverse drug reaction detection BIBREF0, syndromic surveillance BIBREF1, subject recruitment for cancer trials BIBREF2, and characterizing drug abuse BIBREF3, to name a few. Twitter is particularly popular in research due to the availability of the public streaming API, which releases a sample of publicly posted data in real time. While early health-related research from social media focused almost exclusively on population-level studies, some very recent research tasks have focused on performing longitudinal data analysis at the user level, such as mining health-related information from cohorts of pregnant women BIBREF4.", "When conducting user-level studies from social media, one challenge is to ascertain the credibility of the information posted. Particularly, it is important to verify, when deriving statistical estimates from user cohorts, that the user accounts represent humans and not bots (accounts that can be controlled to automatically produce content and interact with other profiles)BIBREF5, BIBREF6. Bots may spread false information by automatically retweeting posts without a human verifying the facts or to influence public opinions on particular topics on purpose BIBREF5, BIBREF7, BIBREF8. For example, a recent study BIBREF9 showed that the highest proportion of anti-vaccine content is generated by accounts with unknown or intermediate bot scores, meaning that the existing methods were not able to fully determine if they were indeed bots. Automatic bot detection techniques mostly rely on extracting features from users' profiles and their social networks BIBREF10, BIBREF11. Some studies have used Honeypot profiles on Twitter to identify and analyze bots BIBREF12, while other studies have analyzed social proximity BIBREF13 or both social and content proximities BIBREF10, tweet timing intervals BIBREF14, or user-level content-based and graph-based features BIBREF15.

Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment.

Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 .

While approaches to mental health classification from texts have long ignored the cultural dimension BIBREF36 , first studies show that online language of individuals affected by depression or related mental health difficulties differs significantly across cultures BIBREF37 , BIBREF36 .", "Concurrently, it has been argued for mental health research that it would constitute a `valuable critical step' BIBREF10 to analyse first-hand accounts by individuals with lived experience of severe mental health issues in blog posts, tweets, and discussion forums. Several severe mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being relapse and symptom free for a sustained period of time BIBREF11 , is considered difficult to achieve BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 . Second, unlike for some other severe mental health difficulties, return to normal functioning is achievable given appropriate treatment BIBREF28 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF29 ."]}

Firstly, it must strictly obey a particular form which specifies the number of lines (i.e., sentences) in the poem and the number of characters in each line. Secondly, it must strictly obey a particular sound pattern which specifies the sound requirement for each character in every position of the poem. Lastly, it must be meaningful, i.e., with grammatical and semantic well-formedness for each line and, with thematic coherence and integrity throughout the poem.

ZAT has a statistically significant mean improvement of $4.04$ , $5.37$ and $3.27$ points over LSTM-BoE with training size 500, 1000 and 2000, respectively. ZAT also shows a statistically significant average improvement of $2.58$ , $2.44$ and $2.5$ points over CT, another zero-shot model with training size 500, 1000 and 2000, respectively. Looking at results for individual domains, the highest improvement for BoE models are seen for transportation and travel. This can be explained by these domains having a high frequency of $timex$ and $location$ slots. But BoE models show a regression in the shopping domain, and a reason could be the low frequency of expert slots. In contrast, ZAT consistently outperforms non-adapted models (CRF and LSTM) by a large margin. This is because ZAT can benefit from other reusable slots than $timex$ and $location$ . Though not as popular as $5.37$0 and $5.37$1 , slots such as $5.37$2 , $5.37$3 , $5.37$4 , and $5.37$5 appear across many domains."]}

Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .", "We have proposed a comprehensive flow of analysing aspects and assigning sentiment orientation to them. The advantages of such an analysis are that: it is a grammatically-based and coherent solution, it shows opinion distribution, it doesn't need any aspect ontology, it is not limited to the number of aspects and really important, it doesn't need training data (unsupervised method). The method proved it has a big potential in generating summary overviews for aspect and sentiment distribution across analysed documents. In our next steps, we want to improve the aspect extraction phase, probably using neural network approaches. Moreover, we want to expand the analysis of the Polish language."]}

First, we use simpler methods for pre-initialization which do not need to pre-generate decoder state statistics. Second, we propose a two-layer pre-initialization mechanism that also avoids performing dynamic expansion on per user basis. In the two-layer pre-initialization method, we make use of a class LM with class tag. We build a personalized FST that contains the members of the class for each user. Using the FST replacement algorithm, we obtain a personalized language transducer BIBREF4. We perform a pre-composition for all FST states whose transitions do not contain class tags. By doing so, the actual on-demand composition is only required for the states in personalized FST. For a multi-threaded service, the pre-composed FST can be shared by all threads, since it does not contain personalized FST states (non-terminals).

The open nature of social media not only poses a plethora of opportunities to understand the basic characteristics of the posts, but also helped us draw novel insights about different representation models.

Tweet length affects the task prediction accuracies, but we found that all models behave similarly under variation in tweet length. Finally while LDA is insensitive to input word order, CNN, LSTM and BLSTM are extremely sensitive to word order.", "Essentially we ask the following question: \u201cWhat are the core properties encoded in the given tweet representation?\u201d. We explicitly group the set of these properties into two categories: syntactic and social. Syntactic category includes properties such as tweet length, the order of words in it, the words themselves, slang words, hashtags and named entities in the tweet. On the other hand, social properties consist of `is reply', and `reply time'. We investigate the degree to which the tweet representations encode these properties. We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task). In this work we perform an extensive evaluation of 9 unsupervised and 4 supervised tweet representation models, using 8 different properties. The most relevant work is that of Adi et al. [5], which investigates three sentence properties in comparing unsupervised sentence representation models such as average of words vectors and LSTM auto-encoders. We differ from their work in two ways: (1) While they focus on sentences, we focus on social media posts which opens up the challenge of considering multiple salient properties such as hashtags, named entities, conversations and so on. (2) While they work with only unsupervised representation-learning models, we investigate the traditional unsupervised methods (BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW, Tweet2Vec), as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM)."]}

However, some approaches consider only the vector representations of entities or subjects (i.e, $\\lbrace s \\in E : \\exists (s, p, o) \\in K \\rbrace $ ). For instance, in approaches based on Tensor Factorization, given a relation, its subjects and objects are processed and transformed into sparse matrices; all the matrices are then combined into a tensor whose depth is the number of relations. For the final embedding, current approaches rely on dimensionality reduction to decrease the overall complexity BIBREF9 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF2 . The reduction is performed through an embedding map $\\Phi : \\mathbb {R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}^k$ , which is a homomorphism that maps the initial vector space into a smaller, reduced space. The positive value $k < d$ is called the rank of the embedding. Note that each dimension of the reduced common space does not necessarily have an explicit connection with a particular relation. Dimensionality reduction methods include Principal Component Analysis techniques BIBREF9 and generative statistical models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 .", "As recently highlighted by several members of the ML and NLP communities, KGEs are rarely evaluated on downstream tasks different from link prediction (also known as knowledge base completion). Achieving high performances on link prediction does not necessarily mean that the generated embeddings are good, since the inference task is often carried out in combination with an external algorithm such as a neural network or a scoring function. The complexity is thus approach-dependent and distributed between the latent structure in the vector model and the parameters (if any) of the inference algorithm. For instance, a translational model such as TransE BIBREF10 would likely feature very complex embeddings, since in most approaches the inference function is a simple addition. On the other hand, we may find less structure in a tensor factorization model such as RESCAL BIBREF7 , as the inference is performed by a feed-forward neural network which extrapolates the hidden semantics layer by layer."]}

This simple approach truly changed the conversation agent landscape. Most of the state-of-the-art today is built on their success.

The encoder summarizes the input utterance into a fixed length vector representation which is input to the decoder, which itself is again a RNN.

The question is whether Laszlo's idea of cybernetics would drive the research of the group towards artificial neural networks. Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\". This seems to suggest that they were aware of the efforts of logicians (such as Bar Hillel, and to some degree Pitts, since Wiener specifically mentions logicians-turned-cyberneticists in his book BIBREF13), but still concluded that a cybernetic approach would probably be a better choice.", "In modern times, the idea of machine translation was put forth by the philosopher and logician Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (most notably in BIBREF1 and BIBREF2), whose papers were studied by the Croatian group. Perhaps the most important unrealized point of contact between machine translation and cybernetics happened in the winter of 1950/51. In that period, Bar-Hillel met Rudolf Carnap in Chicago, who introduced to him the (new) idea of cybernetics. Also, Carnap gave him the contact details of his former teaching assistant, Walter Pitts, who was at that moment with Norbert Wiener at MIT and who was supposed to introduce him to Wiener, but the meeting never took place BIBREF3. Nevertheless, Bar-Hillel was to stay at MIT where he, inspired by cybernetics, would go to organize the first machine translation conference in the world in 1952 BIBREF3."]}

The modelling would be statistical, but its purpose would not be to mimic the stochasticity of the human thought process, but rather to produce a working machine translation system. Kulagina and Melchuk disagreed with this approach as they thought that more of what is presently called \"philosophical logic\" was needed to model the human thought process at the symbolic level, and according to them, the formalization of the human thought process was a prerequisite for developing a machine translation system (cf. BIBREF6). We could speculate that sub-symbolic processing would have been acceptable too, since that approach is also rooted in philosophical logic as a way of formalizing human cognitive functions and is also \"internal\" in the same sense symbolic approaches are.", "The idea of machine translation was a tempting idea in the 1950s. The main military interest in machine translation as an intelligence gathering tool (translation of scientific papers, daily press, technical reports, and everything the intelligence services could get their hands on) was sparked by the Soviet advance in nuclear technology, and would later be compounded by the success of Vostok 1 (termed by the USA as a \u201cstrategic surprise\u201d). In the nuclear age, being able to read and understand what the other side was working on was of crucial importance BIBREF4. Machine translation was quickly absorbed in the program of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956 (where Artificial Intelligence as a field was born), as one of the five core fields of artificial intelligence (later to be known as natural language processing). One other field was included here, the \u201cnerve nets\u201d as they were known back then, today commonly known as artificial neural networks. What is also essential for our discussion is that the earliest programming language for artificial intelligence, Lisp, was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy BIBREF5. But let us take a closer look at the history of machine translation. In the USA, the first major wave of government and military funding for machine translation came in 1954, and the period of abundancy lasted until 1964, when the National Research Council established the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC), which was to assess the results of the ten years of intense funding. The findings were very negative, and funding was almost gone BIBREF4, hence the ALPAC report became the catalyst for the first \u201cAI Winter\u201d."]}

For example, note how in the results for the Medical domain-specific model (first row in Table TABREF28), the BLEU scores on the Law and IT test sets are much higher in comparison to those on the Koran and Subtitles test sets, which clusters are farther away in the visualized embedding space. Similarly, as the Subtitles cluster (Blue) is closer to the Koran cluster (Green), the highest cross-domain BLEU score on the Koran test set is from the Subtitles model. To further quantify this phenomenon, we plot and measure Pearson's correlation between the cosine similarity of the centroids for the English BERT-based dev sentence representations for each domain pair, and the cross-domain BLEU score for this domain pair. This is shown in Figure FIGREF29. We can see the general trend where the closer the domain centroids are (with a similarity of 1 for training and evaluating on the same domain), the higher the cross-domain BLEU is between those domains, resulting in a Pearson's correlation of 0.81 (strong correlation).

From the top block of the table, as expected and discussed above, the rule-based method sets the records of style preservation and fluency scores, as it only conducts lightweight token replacement on reference sentences.

These results also lead us to a practical heuristic, that an intent annotation which spans only one or two words should not be considered for rescoring. Application of this heuristic results in an estimated accuracy of 77%. We use this heuristic in further experiments. A stricter heuristic would require at least four words span, with an accuracy of 87.7%.

Following such approaches, there has been a number of techniques aimed at generating adversarial examples BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Depending on the degree of access to the target model, an adversary may operate in one of the two different settings: (a) black-box setting, where an adversary doesn't have access to target model's internal architecture or its parameters, (b) white-box setting, where an adversary has access to the target model, its parameters, and input feature representations. In both these settings, the adversary cannot alter the training data or the target model itself. Depending on the purpose of the adversary, adversarial attacks can be categorized as (a) targeted attack and (b) non-targeted attack.

In textual domain, even a small perturbation is clearly perceptible and can completely change the semantics of the text. Another challenge for generating adversarial examples relates to identifying salient areas of the text where a perturbation can be applied successfully to fool the target classifier.

The English embeddings should be kept but the Uzbek embeddings should be modified during training of the child model.

Clearly both name frequency and the degree of gender-specificity are relevant to this bipartite matching. If only frequency were considered, a more gender-neutral name (e.g. Taylor) could be paired with a very gender-specific name (e.g. John), which would negate the gender intervention in many cases (namely whenever a male occurrence of Taylor is transformed into John, which would also result in incorrect pronouns, if present). If, on the other hand, only the degree of gender-specificity were considered, we would see frequent names (like James) being paired with far less frequent names (like Sybil), which would distort the overall frequency distribution of names. This might also result in the retention of a gender signal: for instance, swapping a highly frequent male name with a rare female name might simply make the rare female name behave as a new link between masculine contexts (instead of the original male name), as it rarely appears in female contexts.", "We compare eight variations of the mitigation methods.

While this kind of E2E approach significantly simplifies the speech recognition pipeline, the weakness is that it is difficult to tune the strength of each component. One particular problem from our observations is that the attention based E2E model tends to make grammatical errors, which indicates that the language modeling power of the model is weak, possibly due to the small amount of training data, or the mismatch between the training and evaluation data. However, due to the jointly model approach in the attention model, it is unclear how to improve the strength of the language modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the previous output tokens in the decoder, or to improve the strength of the acoustic modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the context vector from the encoder.", "As far as we know, our model is the best E2E ASR system on the Librispeech testset, which achieves a comparable result with wav2letter Transformer on test-clean dataset and a better result on test-other dataset, even though our model (75M parameters) is much smaller than the wav2letter Transformer (210M parameters).

We carried the same computation in the context of frequencies of translated female pronouns, and the resulting histograms are plotted side-by-side in Figure FIGREF29 . The data shows us that Google Translate outputs fail to follow the real-world distribution of female workers across a comprehensive set of job positions. The distribution of translated female pronouns is consistently inversely distributed, with female pronouns accumulating in the first 12-quantile. By contrast, BLS data shows that female participation peaks in the fourth 12-quantile and remains significant throughout the next ones.", "Averaged over occupations and languages, sentences are translated with female pronouns INLINEFORM0 of the time. In contrast, the gender participation frequency for female workers averaged over all occupations in the BLS report yields a consistently larger figure of INLINEFORM1 . The variance reported for the translation results is also lower, at INLINEFORM2 in contrast with the report's INLINEFORM3 . We ran an one-sided t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the female participation frequency is not significantly greater then the GT female pronoun frequency for the same job positions, obtaining a p-value INLINEFORM4 vastly inferior to our confidence level of INLINEFORM5 and thus rejecting H0 and concluding that Google Translate's female translation frequencies sub-estimates female participation frequencies in US job positions. As a result, it is not possible to understand this asymmetry as a reflection of workplace demographics, and the prominence of male defaults in Google Translate is, we believe, yet lacking a clear justification."]}

To mitigate the introduction noisy labels when using semi-supervised techniques, BIBREF2 incorporates crowdsourcing to manually accept or reject the newly introduced labels. One major drawback of these approaches is that they require manually labelled seed data to construct the knowledge base of attribute-value pairs, which can be quite expensive for a large number of attributes.

The major advantages of this approach are: 1) the fact that there are no hand-crafted rules encoded; 2) the ability to handle misspelled words (because the search engine alleviates that and returns relevant or related information) and incomplete sentences; 3) the generic design of its components, allowing multilingual processing with little effort (the only dependency is the POS tagger) and straightforward extension to support more NER classes (requiring a corpus of images and text associated to each desired NER class, which can be obtained from a Knowledge Base, such as DBpedia, and an image dataset, such as METU dataset). While initial results in a gold standard dataset showed the potential of the approach, we also plan to integrate these outcomes into a Sequence Labeling (SL) system, including neural architectures such as LSTM, which are more suitable for such tasks as NER or POS.

Holding that irony activates both grammatical / explicit as well as ironic / involved notions provides that irony will be more difficult to grasp than a non-ironic use of the same expression.", "The linguistic phenomenon of figurative language (FL) refers to the contradiction between the literal and the non-literal meaning of an utterance BIBREF18. Literal written language assigns \u2018exact\u2019 (or \u2018real\u2019) meaning to the used words (or phrases) without any reference to putative speech figures. In contrast, FL schemas exploit non-literal mentions that deviate from the exact concept presented by the used words and phrases. FL is rich of various linguistic phenomena like \u2018metonymy\u2019 reference to an entity stands for another of the same domain, a more general case of \u2018synonymy\u2019; and \u2018metaphors\u2019 systematic interchange between entities from different abstract domains BIBREF19. Besides the philosophical considerations, theories and debates about the exact nature of FL, findings from the neuroscience research domain present clear evidence on the presence of differentiating FL processing patterns in the human brain BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23, BIBREF14, even for woman-man attraction situations! BIBREF24. A fact that makes FL processing even more challenging and difficult to tackle. Indeed, this is the case of pragmatic FL phenomena like irony and sarcasm that main intention of in most of the cases, are characterized by an oppositeness to the literal language context. It is crucial to distinguish between the literal meaning of an expression considered as a whole from its constituents\u2019 words and phrases. As literal meaning is assumed to be invariant in all context at least in its classical conceptualization BIBREF25, it is exactly this separation of an expression from its context that permits and opens the road to computational approaches in detecting and characterizing FL utterance."]}

This limitation in the size of samples (only one or very few examples) challenges the standard fine-tuning method in DL. Early studies in this field BIBREF3 applied data augmentation and regularization techniques to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by data scarcity but only to a limited extent. Instead, researchers have been inspired by human learning to explore meta-learning BIBREF4 to leverage the distribution over similar tasks. Contemporary approaches to few-shot learning often decompose the training procedure into an auxiliary meta-learning phase, which includes many sub-tasks, following the principle that the testing and training conditions must match. They extract some transferable knowledge by switching the task from one mini-batch to the next. Moreover, the few-shot model is able to classify data into new classes with just a small labeled support set."]}

The SELECT query form is the most commonly used and is used to return rows of variable bindings. Therefore, we use this type of query in our explanation. CONSTRUCT allows to create a new RDF graph or modify the existing one through substituting variables in a graph templates for each solution.

Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks. On the other hand, Waseem and Hovy noted that INLINEFORM1 of all the disagreements in annotation of their dataset occurred on the sexism class. Sexism is typically both generalized and implicit."]}

Our systems are not optimised for this because it would predict scores of -0.01 and true value of 0.01 as very close (within vector of other results) with low error whereas metric 2 would give this the highest error rating of -1 as they are not the same sign. Metric 3 is more similar to metric 1 as shown by the results, however the crucial difference is that again if you get opposite signs it will penalise more. We analysed the top 50 errors based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the test dataset specifically to examine the number of sentences containing more than one aspect. Our investigation shows that no one system is better at predicting the sentiment of sentences that have more than one aspect (i.e. company) within them.

This study follows below steps (see Figure.FIGREF7), and uses Python packages such as NLTK, NetworkX and SKlearn.", "The particular algorithm of network community detection used in this study is Louvain method BIBREF2 which partitions a network into the number of nodes - every node is its own comunity, and from there, clusters the nodes in a way to maximize each cluster's modularity which indicates how strong is the connectivity between the nodes in the community. This means that, based on the cosine similarity scores - the networks edge weights, the algorithm clusters similar sentences together in a same community while the algorithm proceeds maximizing the connectivity strength amongst the nodes in each community. The network constructed with no threshold in place was detected to have 18 distinct communities with three single node communities. Based on the visualized network (see Figure.FIGREF13), it seemed that the network community detection method clustered the sentence network as good as the original data set with human labeled classes although the communities do not look quite distinct. However, based on the fact that it had three single node communities and the number of distinct communities is less than the number of classes in the human labeled data set, we suspected possible problems that would degrade the quality of the community detection for the use of training text classification models."]}

This human labeling practice indeed impacts on the quality of the trained models in solving classificastion problems.", "In this paper, we study further to show the usefulness of the network community detection on labeling unlabeled text data that will automate and improve human labeling tasks, and on training machine learning classification models for a particular text classification problem.

This actually can help improve the text classification based systems to work more sophisticatedly as the data set gets more detailed subclasses to design the systems with. Although, it is indeed a helpful phenomena, we would like to minimize the number of subclasses created by the community detection algorithm simply because we want to avoid having too many subclasses that would add more complexity in designing any applications using the community data. On the other hand, the Class-merge happens when multiple human labeled classes are merged into one giant community. This Class-merge phenomena also helps improve the original data set by detecting either misslabeled or ambiguous data entries. We will discuss more details in the following subsection. Nonetheless, we also want to minimize the number of classes merged into the one giant community, because when too many classes are merged into one class, it simply implies that the sentence network is not correctly clustered. For example, as shown in Figure.FIGREF15 red lines, 12 different human labeled classes that do not share any similar intents are merged into COMMUNITY_7. If we trained a text classification model on this data, we would have lost the specifically designed purposes of the 12 different classes, expecting COMMUNITY_7 to deal with all the 12 different types of sentences. This would dramatically degrade the performance of the text classification models.", "In order to quantify the degree of Class-split and Class-merge of a network, and to find out optimal connectivity threshold that would yield the sentence network with the best community detection quality, we built two metrics using the class map. We quantified the Class-split by counting the number of communities splitted out from each and every human labeled class, and the Class-merge by counting the number of human labeled classes that are merged into each and every community. We then averaged the Class-splits across all the human labeled classes and Class-merges across all the communities. For example, using the class map of the sentence network with no threshold, we can easily get the number of Class-split and Class-merge as below. By averaging them, we get the Class_split and Class_merge scores of the sentence network, which is 2.7368 and 2.8333 respectively."]}

Swearwords and slang, that are quite prevalent in this type of corpus BIBREF7 , BIBREF6 , appear at both ends of the regime that suggests that some specific forms of swearing disappear with urbanization, but the share of overall swearing on Twitter grows with city size. The peak consisting of Spanish words at the superlinear end of the exponent distribution marks the stronger presence of the biggest non-English speaking ethnicity in bigger urban areas. This is confirmed by fitting the scaling relationship to the Hispanic or Latino population BIBREF53 of the MSA areas ( INLINEFORM0 , see SI), which despite the large error, is very superlinear."]}

Therefore, it is necessary to find out the biased data points in ReClor in order to evaluate models in a more comprehensive manner BIBREF43. To this end, we feed the five strong baseline models (GPT, GPT-2, BERT$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$, XLNet$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$ and RoBERTa$_{\\small \\textsc {BASE}}$) with ONLY THE ANSWER OPTIONS for each problem. In other words, we purposely remove the context and question in the inputs. In this way, we are able to identify those problems that can be answered correctly by merely exploiting the biases in answer options without knowing the relevant context and question. However, the setting of this task is a multiple-choice question with 4 probable options, and even a chance baseline could have 25% probability to get it right. To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set. Then, the data points which are predicted correctly by the models at random could be nearly eliminated, since any data point only has a probability of $(25\\%)^{4}=0.39\\%$ to be guessed right consecutively for four times.

In order to fully assess the logical reasoning ability of the models, we propose to identify the biased data points and group them as EASY set, and put the rest into HARD set. Based on our experiments on these separate sets, we find that even the state-of-the-art models can only perform well on EASY set and struggle on HARD set as shown in Figure FIGREF4. This phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines. On the other hand, human beings perform similarly on both the EASY and HARD set. It is thus observed that there is still a long way to go to equip models with true logical reasoning ability."]}

It has the same idea as in BIBREF8 but has a more complicated system of rules with priorities. The model contains 45 different groups and about 300 patterns as sub-groups, each of which uses a keyword with regular expressions to match the preceding and following texts. Each pattern also has a priority value. During normalization, each sentence is fed as input and the NSW will be matched by the regular expressions. The model tries to match patterns with longer context and slowly decrease the context length until a match is found. If there are multiple pattern matches with the same length, the one with a higher priority will be chosen for the NSW. The model has been developed on abundant test data and bad cases. The advantage of the rule-based system is the flexibility, since one can simply add more special cases when they appear, such as new units. However, improving the performance of this system on more general cases becomes a bottleneck. For example, in a report of a football game, it cannot transform \u201c1-3\u201d to score if there are no keywords like \u201cscore\u201d or \u201cgame\u201d close to it.", "Text Normalization (TN) is a process to transform non-standard words (NSW) into spoken-form words (SFW) for disambiguation.

Similarly, the wait-k model also brings an obvious decrease in translation quality, even with the best wait-15 policy, its performance is still worse than the baseline system, with a 2.15 drop, averagely, in BLEU (40.39 INLINEFORM1 38.24). For a machine translation product, a large degradation in translation quality will largely affect the use experience even if it has low latency.", "Effectiveness on latency. As latency in simultaneous machine translation is essential and is worth to be intensively investigated, we compare the latency of our models with that of the previous work using our Equilibrium Efficiency metric. As shown in Figure FIGREF58 , we plot the translation quality and INLINEFORM0 on the NIST06 dev set. Clearly, compared to the baseline system, our model significantly reduce the time delay while remains a competitive translation quality. When treating segments as IUs, the latency can be further reduced by approximate 20% (23.13 INLINEFORM1 18.65), with a slight decrease in BLEU score (47.61 INLINEFORM2 47.27). One interesting finding is that the granularity of information units largely affects both the translation quality and latency. It is clear the decoding based on sub-sentence and based on segment present different performance in two metrics. For the former model, the increase of discarded tokens results in an obvious decrease in translation quality, but no definite improvement in latency. The latter model can benefit from the increasing of discarding tokens both in translation quality and latency."]}

For example, they may define a slice because it contains related content, e.g., \u201cnutrition-related queries\u201d or because the subset has an interesting product feature, e.g., \u201cqueries with complex disambiguation\u201d.

The scores reported are an average of the BLEU scores (in percentage points, or pp) BIBREF46 over the test sets of 5 independently trained models. Table TABREF44 shows the results over the en-fr dataset. In this case, the models with ReWE have outperformed the LSTM and transformer baselines consistently. The LSTM did not benefit from using BPE, but the transformer+ReWE with BPE reached $36.30$ BLEU pp (a $+0.99$ pp improvement over the best model without ReWE). For this dataset we did not use ReSE because French was the target language.", "For the eu-en dataset (Table TABREF46), the results show that, again, ReWE outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Moreover, ReWE+ReSE has been able to improve the results even further ($+3.15$ BLEU pp when using BPE and $+5.15$ BLEU pp at word level over the corresponding baselines). Basque is, too, a morphologically-rich language and using BPE has proved very beneficial ($+4.27$ BLEU pp over the best word-level model). As noted before, the eu-en dataset is very low-resource (less than $100,000$ sentence pairs) and it is more likely that the baseline models generalize poorly. Consequently, regularizers such as ReWE and ReSE are more helpful, with larger margins of improvement with respect to the baselines. On a separate note, the transformer has unexpectedly performed well below the LSTM on this dataset, and especially so with BPE. We speculate that it may be more sensitive than the LSTM to the dataset's much smaller size, or in need of more refined hyper-parameter tuning."]}
