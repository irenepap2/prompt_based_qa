MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table TABREF21, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the information, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \u201cwhy would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d while MISSA was able to generate the response \u201cwhy can't you use my address?\u201d, which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations."]}

Curiously, the MTL parser is worse than the the pipeline parser, but the MTL case tagger is better than the pipeline case tagger (Table 7 ). This indicates that the MTL model must learn to encode case in the model's representation, but must not learn to effectively use it for parsing. Finally, we observe that augmenting the char-lstm with either gold or predicted case improves the parsing performance for all languages, and indeed closes the performance gap with the full oracle, which has access to all morphological features.

This means that INLINEFORM0 learned from English can successfully encode the sequential phonetic structures into fixed-length vector for the target languages to some good extend even though it has never seen any audio data of the target languages. Another interesting fact is the corresponding variance between languages.

When evaluated on non-factoid QA datasets, there is a big gap between BERT embeddings and the fully fine-tuned BERT, which suggests that deep interactions between questions and answers are critical to the task. However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected. Similar to BERT for sentence embeddings, mean-pooling and combining the top and bottom layer embeddings lead to better performance, and $(u, v, u * v, |u - v|)$ shows the strongest results among other interaction schemes. Different from sentence-level embeddings, fine-tuning BERT on SNLI doesn't lead to significant improvement, which suggests possible domain mismatch between SNLI and the QA datasets.

In this paper, we describe briefly the whole workflow and present a prototype implementation. Currently, existing solutions for sentiment annotation offer mostly analysis on the level of entire documents, and if you go deeper to the level of individual product features, they are only superficial and poorly prepared for the analysis of large volumes of data. This can especially be seen in scientific articles where the analysis is carried out on a few hundred reviews only. It is worth mentioning that this task is extremely problematic because of the huge diversity of languages and the difficulty of building a single solution that can cover all the languages used in the world. Natural language analysis often requires additional pre-processing steps, especially at the stage of preparing the data for analysis, and steps specific for each language. Large differences can be seen in the analysis of the Polish language (a highly inflected language) and English (a grammatically simpler one). We propose a solution that will cover several languages, however in this prototype implementation we focused on English texts only."]}

Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 ."]}

We consider events for which a person is the subject (e.g, \u201cPersonX listens to PersonX's music\u201d) to be human activities, and remove the rest (e.g., \u201cIt is Christmas morning\u201d). We then use several simple rules to convert the Event2Mind instances into first-person past-tense activities. Since all events were already filtered so that they begin with \u201cPersonX\u201d, we replace the first occurrence of \u201cPersonX\u201d in each event with \u201cI\u201d and all subsequent occurrences with \u201cme\u201d. All occurrences of \u201cPersonX's\u201d become \u201cmy\u201d, and the main verb in each phrase is conjugated to its past-tense form using the Pattern python module. For example, the event \u201cPersonX teaches PersonX's son\u201d becomes the query \u201cI taught my son\u201d. Since Event2Mind also contains wildcard placeholders that can match any span of text within the same phrase (e.g., \u201cPersonX buys INLINEFORM0 at the store\u201d) but the Twitter API doesn't provide a mechanism for wildcard search, we split the event on the string INLINEFORM1 and generate a query that requires all substrings to appear in the tweet.

BLSTM outperforms the LSTM variant in all the tasks except `Content', which signifies the power of using the information flowing from both the directions of the tweet. T2V which is expected to perform well in this task because of its ability to work at a more fine level (i.e., characters) performs the worst. In fact T2V does not outperform other models in any task, which could be mainly due to the fact that the hashtags which are used for supervision in learning tweet representations reduces the generalization capability of the tweets beyond hashtag prediction. Prediction tasks such as `Content' and `Hashtag' seem to be less difficult as all the models perform nearly optimal for them. The superior performance of all the models for the `Content' task in particular is unlike the relatively lower performance reported for in [5], mainly because of the short length of the tweets. The most surprising result is when the BOM model turned out to be the best in `Word Order' task, as the model by nature loses the word order.

Then, given a conversational history or source sequence S, they identify the \u201cfocus\u201d in S, which is the text span (one or more entities) based on which they form a query to link to the facts. The query is then used to retrieve all contextually relevant facts. Finally, both conversation history and relevant facts are fed into a neural architecture that features distinct encoders for conversation history and facts.

As computation power increased, and we developed neural networks that were able to capture long range dependencies (RNNs,GRUs,LSTMs) the field moved towards neural models for building these agents. Sequence to sequence model created in 2015 was capable of handling utterances of variable lengths, the application of sequence to sequence to conversation agents truly revolutionized the domain.

They do not detail or cite the articles they mention. However, the fact that they referred to them in a text published in 1959 (probably prepared for publishing in 1958, based on BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 described that the group had started its work in 1958) leads us to the conclusion that the poorly funded Croatian research was lagging only a couple of years behind the research of the superpowers (which invested heavily in this effort). Another interesting moment, which they delineated in BIBREF11, is that the group soon discovered that some experimental work had already been done in 1957 at the Institute of Telecommunications (today a part of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb) by Vladimir Matkovi\u0107.

First, the group seemed to think that encodings would be needed, but it seems that entropy-based encodings and calculations added no real benefits (i.e. added no benefit that would not be offset by the cost of calculating the codes). In addition, Finka and Laszlo BIBREF10 seem to place great emphasis on lemmatization instead of stemming, which, if they had constructed a prototype, they would have noticed it to be very hard to tackle with the technology of the age. Nevertheless, the idea of proper lemmatization would probably be replaced with moderately precise hard-coded stemming, made with the help of the \"inverse dictionary\", which Finka and Laszlo proposed as one of the key tasks in their 1962 paper. This paper also highlights the need for a frequency count and taking only the most frequent words, which is an approach that later became widely used in the natural language processing community. Sentential alignment coupled with part-of-speech tagging was correctly identified as one of the key aspects of machine translation, but its complexity was severely underestimated by the group. One might argue that these two modules are actually everything that is needed for a successful machine translation system, which shows the complexity of the task."]}

The question is whether Laszlo's idea of cybernetics would drive the research of the group towards artificial neural networks. Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrovi\u0107 note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\". This seems to suggest that they were aware of the efforts of logicians (such as Bar Hillel, and to some degree Pitts, since Wiener specifically mentions logicians-turned-cyberneticists in his book BIBREF13), but still concluded that a cybernetic approach would probably be a better choice."]}

The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Muli\u0107 BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8. It is also interesting to note that the Andreev group had a profound influence on the Czechoslovakian machine translation program BIBREF9, which unfortunately suffered a similar fate as the Yugoslav one due to the lack of funding."]}

Each of the resulting record-sentence pairs is treated as a pair of INLINEFORM0 , namely (content record, auxiliary sentence). The next step is to find a suitable reference sentence INLINEFORM1 for each content record INLINEFORM2 . As defined above, the reference sentence should cover similar but not the same content as in record INLINEFORM3 . We achieve this by retrieving from the data another record-sentence pair using INLINEFORM4 , where the retrieved record is designated to have a slightly different structure than that of INLINEFORM5 by having less or more tuples and different data types.

The main idea underlying those models is to learn disentangled representations of text so as modify textual attributes or style of interest. Those papers used different objectives to encourage learning disentangled representations. BIBREF9 used pre-trained classifiers as the supervision. BIBREF10 used a GAN-based approach in which binary classifiers were used as discriminators. BIBREF15 proposed to use more structured discriminators such as language models to provide better supervision to the generator. BIBREF16 , BIBREF11 further augmented prior work using back-translation technique to incorporate cycle-consistency loss. Both BIBREF11 and BIBREF12 generalized the task to controlling multiple categorical attributes at the same time. Our work differs from those in that we assume an existing sentence to provide the source of style and a structured record as the source of content. The input content record in our task is also more structured than the style attributes which are typically loosely connected and of a pre-fixed number.

For this reason, EM+Prune methods proceed iteratively, only pruning subwords up to a predefined iteration pruning quota, e.g. removing at most 20% of the remaining lexicon at a time."]}

Since parallel sense tagged data are not always available, they use Google Translate to translate a manually sense tagged corpus. In addition they apply automatic sense tagging of a manually translated parallel corpus, whereby they report worse performance compared to the previous approach. We try to overcome this issue by engaging up to ten languages to improve the performance of the automatic sense tagging. Similarly, BabelNet BIBREF5 aligns the lexicographic knowledge from WordNet to the encyclopaedic knowledge of Wikipedia. This is done by assigning WordNet synsets to Wikipedia entries, and making these relations multilingual through the interlingual links. For languages, which do not have the corresponding Wikipedia entry, the authors use Google Translate to translate English sentences containing the synset in the sense annotated corpus. After that, the most frequent translation is included as a variant for the synset for the given language."]}

The resource is made by combining different wordnets together, knowledge from Wiktionary and the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. Overall they obtained over 2 million senses for over 100 thousand concepts, linking over 1.4 million words in hundreds of languages. Since using existing lexical resources guarantees a high precision, it may also provide a low recall due to the limitedness of lexical resources in different languages and domains. A different approach to expand English WordNet synsets with lexicalizations in other languages was proposed in BIBREF51 . The authors do not directly match concepts in the two different language resources, but demonstrate an approach that learns how to determine the best translation for English synsets by taking bilingual dictionaries, structural information of the English WordNet and corpus frequency information into account. With the growing amount of parallel data, BIBREF52 show an approach to acquire a set of synsets from parallel corpora. The synsets are obtained by comparing aligned words in parallel corpora in several languages. Similarly, the sloWNet for Slovene BIBREF53 and Wolf for French BIBREF12 are constructed using a multilingual corpus and word alignment techniques in combination with other existing lexical resources. Since all these approaches use word alignment information, they are not able to generate any translation equivalents for multi-word expressions (MWE). In contrast, our approach use an SMT system trained on a large amount of parallel sentences, which allows us to align possible MWEs, such as commercial loan or take a breath, between source and target language. Furthermore, we engage the idea of identifying relevant contextual information to support an SMT system translating short expressions, which showed better performance compared to approaches without a context. BIBREF54 built small domain-specific translation models for ontology translation from relevant sentence pairs that were identified in a parallel corpus based on the ontology labels to be translated. With this approach they improve the translation quality over the usage of large generic translation models. Since the generation of translation models can be computational expensive, BIBREF55 use large generic translation models to translate ontology labels, which were placed into a disambiguated context. With this approach the authors demonstrate translation quality improvement over commercial systems, like Microsoft Translator. Different from this approach, which uses the hierarchical structure of the ontology for disambiguation, we engage a large number of different languages to identify the relevant context."]}

Conversely, models tend to assign lower log probability scores to sentences with doubled datives, likely because these sentences lack either a nominative or an accusative, both of which are more frequent than dative. This leads to better than human performance on this case violation. Such behavior is probably due to the fact that German being a non pro-drop language, every verb must have a nominative case, making nominative more frequent than accusative, and that dative even rarer.

Contrary to humans, neural language models are overly sensitive to frequency distribution of phrase types.

This trend is more extreme in the social media dataset, but it is found with the same order of magnitude in both datasets. The figure is cut off above 2.0% in order to visualize the long-tail of very infrequent languages. The biggest driver of this trend is English, accounting for 37.46% of social media and 29.96% of web data. This is the case even though both datasets have large numbers of observations from locations which are not traditionally identified as English-speaking countries, suggesting that in digital contexts these countries default to global languages which they do not use natively."]}

This model directly learns the mapping from the input acoustic signals to the output transcriptions without decomposing the problems into several different modules such as lexicon modeling, acoustic modeling and language modeling as in the conventional hybrid architecture. While this kind of E2E approach significantly simplifies the speech recognition pipeline, the weakness is that it is difficult to tune the strength of each component. One particular problem from our observations is that the attention based E2E model tends to make grammatical errors, which indicates that the language modeling power of the model is weak, possibly due to the small amount of training data, or the mismatch between the training and evaluation data. However, due to the jointly model approach in the attention model, it is unclear how to improve the strength of the language modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the previous output tokens in the decoder, or to improve the strength of the acoustic modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the context vector from the encoder."]}

The proliferation of online commerce and customer feedback has significantly motivated companies to invest in intelligent text analysis tools and technologies where sentiment analysis plays a crucial role. There have traditionally been two main approaches to sentiment analysis. The first one uses unsupervised algorithms, sentiment lexicons and word similarity measures to mine emotions in raw texts. The second uses emotionally-labeled text datasets to train supervised (or deep supervised) algorithms and use them to predict emotions in other documents. Naturally, most of sentiment analysis research has been conducted for the English language. Chinese BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 and Spanish BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 have also received a considerable extra attention in the last years. Smaller languages like Czech have seen fewer efforts in this aspect. It is thus much easier to find online data resources for English than for other languages BIBREF6 . One of the first attempts to create sentiment annotated resources of Czech texts dates back in 2012 BIBREF7 . Authors released three datasets of news articles, movie reviews, and product reviews. A subsequent work consisted in creating a Czech dataset of information technology product reviews, their aspects and customers' attitudes towards those aspects BIBREF8 . This latter dataset is an essential basis for performing aspect-based sentiment analysis experiments BIBREF9 . Another available resource is a dataset of ten thousand Czech Facebook posts and the corresponding emotional labels BIBREF10 . The authors report various experimental results with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME) classifiers. Despite the creation of the resources mentioned above and the results reported by the corresponding authors, there is still little evidence about the performance of various techniques and algorithms on sentiment analysis of Czech texts. In this paper, we perform an empirical survey, probing many popular supervised learning algorithms on sentiment prediction of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We perform document-level analysis considering the text part (that is usually short) as a single document and explore various parameters of Tf-Idf vectorizer and each classification algorithms reporting the optimal ones. According to our results, SVM (Support Vector Machine) is the best player, shortly followed by Logistic Regression (LR) and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB). Moreover, we observe that ensemble techniques like Random Forests (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) or voting schemes do not increase the performance of the basic classifiers. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section \"Czech Facebook Dataset\" presents some details and statistics about the two Czech datasets we used. Section \"PREPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION\" describes the text preprocessing steps and vectorizer parameters we grid-searched. Section \"SUPERVISED ALGORITHMS\" presents in details the grid-searched parameters and values of all classifiers. In Section \"RESULTS\" , we report the optimal parameter values and test scores in each dataset. Finally, Section \"CONCLUSIONS\" concludes and presents possible future contributions."]}

Specifically, five human evaluators, who are native Chinese and expert in English, are asked to evaluate the translations of 500 source sentences randomly sampled from the test sets without knowing which system a translation is selected from. The score ranges from 0 to 5. For a translation result, the higher its score is, the more faithful it is. Table 2 shows the average results of five subjective evaluations on CH-EN translation.

However, after measuring the average income of active users in a given hour over a week, we obtained an even more sophisticated picture. It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier).

On the other hand, people from the South used a language which is somewhat closer to the standard (in terms of the aforementioned linguistic markers) and a more diverse vocabulary. The most notable exception is Paris, where in the city center people used more standard language, while the contrary is true for the suburbs. This observation, better shown in Fig. 3 a inset, can be explained by the large differences in average socioeconomic status between districts. Such segregation is known to divide the Eastern and Western sides of suburban Paris, and in turn to induce apparent geographic patterns of standard language usage. We found less evident longitudinal dependencies of the observed variables. Although each variable shows a somewhat diagonal trend, the most evident longitudinal dependency appeared for the average rate of standard pluralization (see Fig. 3 b), where users from the Eastern side of the country used the language in less standard ways. Note that we also performed a multivariate regression analysis (not shown here), using the linguistic markers as target and considering as factors both location (in terms of latitude and longitude) as and income as proxy of socioeconomic status. It showed that while location is a strong global determinant of language variability, socioeconomic variability may still be significant locally to determine standard language usage (just as we demonstrated in the case of Paris)."]}

Word2Vec BIBREF9 showed that we can use vectors to properly represent words in a way that captures semantic or meaning-related relationships. While Word2Vec is a context-free model that generates a single word-embedding for each word in the vocabulary, BERT generates a representation of each word that is based on the other words in the sentence. It was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations, such as ELMo BIBREF10 and ULMFit BIBREF11, and is deeply bidirectional, representing each word using both its left and right context. We use the pre-trained models of BERT and fine-tune it on the dataset of fake news and satire articles using Adam optimizer with 3 types of decay and 0.01 decay rate.

That is to say that even if we do not expect a 50:50 distribution of translated gender pronouns, Google Translate exhibits male defaults in a greater frequency that job occupation data alone would suggest.

In this paper, we suggest that and test the hypothesis that statistical translation tools can be probed to yield insights about stereotypical gender roles in our society \u2013 or at least in their training data. By translating professional-related sentences such as \u201cHe/She is an engineer\u201d from gender neutral languages such as Hungarian and Chinese into English, we were able to collect statistics about the asymmetry between female and male pronominal genders in the translation outputs. Our results show that male defaults are not only prominent, but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) occupations. And because Google Translate typically uses English as a lingua franca to translate between other languages (e.g. Chinese INLINEFORM0 English INLINEFORM1 Portuguese) BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 , our findings possibly extend to translations between gender neutral languages and non-gender neutral languages (apart from English) in general, although we have not tested this hypothesis."]}

Specifically, we can translate sentences such as the Hungarian \u201c\u0151 egy \u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d, where \u201c\u00e1pol\u00f3n\u0151\u201d translates to \u201cnurse\u201d and \u201c\u0151\u201d is a gender-neutral pronoun meaning either he, she or it, to English, yielding in this example the result \u201cshe's a nurse\u201d on Google Translate. As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when \u201cnurse\u201d is replaced by \u201cengineer\u201d. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions \u2013 which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias \u2013, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( \u201cComputer occupations, all other\u201d, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (\u201chost/hostess\u201d, \u201cwaiter/waitress\u201d). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 . We made all code and data used to generate and compile the results presented in the following sections publicly available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/marceloprates/Gender-Bias.

Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks.

Another notable example is the ULMFit model BIBREF8, which specifically focuses on techniques for domain adaptation of LSTM-based language models.

The figure shows that bias-attention consistently performs poorly compared to other approaches. As expected, matrix-based representations perform the worst when injected to embeddings and encoder, however we can already see improvements over bias-attention when these representations are injected to attention and classifier. This is because the number of parameters used in the the weight matrices of attention and classifier are relatively smaller compared to those of embeddings and encoder, thus they are easier to optimize. The CHIM-based representations perform the best among other approaches, where CHIM-embedding garners the highest accuracy across datasets.

QANet is a Transformer-based BIBREF26 comprehension model, where the encoder consists of stacked convolution and self-attention layers. The objective of the model is to predict the position of the starting and ending indices of the answer words in the context. decaNLP is a recurrent network-based comprehension model trained on ten NLP tasks simultaneously, all casted as a question-answer problem. Much of decaNLP's flexibility is due to its pointer-generator network, which allows it to generate words by extracting them from the question or context passages, or by drawing them from a vocabulary. BERT is a deep bi-directional encoder model based on Transformers. It is pre-trained on a large corpus in an unsupervised fashion using a masked language model and next-sentence prediction objective. To apply BERT to a specific task, the standard practice is to add additional output layers on top of the pre-trained BERT and fine-tune the whole model for the task. In our case for RC, 2 output layers are added: one for predicting the start index and another the end index. BIBREF12 demonstrates that this transfer learning strategy produces state-of-the-art performance on a range of NLP tasks. For RC specifically, BERT (BERT-Large) achieved an F1 score of 93.2 on squad, outperforming human performance by 2 points."]}

The second application (section SECREF17) focused on the extraction and integration of knowledge, encoded in commonsense knowledge bases, for guiding the learning process of neural language models in question-answering tasks. Although diverse in scope and breadth, both projects adopt a hybrid approach to building AI systems, where deep neural networks are enhanced with knowledge graphs. For instance, in the first project we demonstrated that scenes that are visually different can be discovered as sharing similar semantic characteristics by using knowledge graph embeddings; in the second project we showed that a language model is more accurate when it includes specialized modules to evaluate questions and candidate answers on the basis of a common knowledge graph. In both cases, explainability emerges as a property of the mechanisms that we implemented, through this combination of data-driven algorithms with the relevant knowledge resources."]}

Each detected IU is then translated into a fluent translation with two simple yet effective decoding strategies: partial decoding and context-aware decoding. Specifically, IUs at the beginning of each sentence are sent to the partial decoding module. Other information units, either appearing in the middle or at the end of a sentence, are translated into target language by the context-aware decoding module. Notice that this module is able to exploit additional context from the history so that the model can generate coherent translation. This method is derived from the \u201csalami technique\u201d BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , or \u201cchunking\u201d, one of the most commonly used strategies by human interpreters to cope with the linearity constraint in simultaneous interpreting.

Conversely, position embeddings can also be the basis for a context-sensitive second-level text representation. We have to start somewhere when we represent text. Position embeddings are motivated by the desire to provide a representation that can be computed easily and quickly (i.e., without taking context into account), but that on the other hand is much richer than the symbolic alphabet."]}

The model trained using ReWE has been able to consistently outperform the baseline in both language directions. The trend we had observed in the supervised case has applied to these experiments, too: the performance margin has been larger for smaller training data sizes. For example, in the en-fr direction the margin has been $+1.74$ BLEU points with 50K training sentences, but it has reduced to $+0.44$ BLEU points when training with 10M sentences. Again, this behavior is in line with the regularizing nature of the proposed regressive objectives."]}

This means that the trained models were able to catch signals of personality from the annotated data. Extraversion and agreeableness were easiest to estimate. The smallest differences in MAE between the trained models and the dummy regressor are for extraversion and conscientiousness, for models trained on the lower reliability dataset $D_\\textrm {\\textit {LR}}$. The explanation for this might be that both of the factors are quite complicated to detect in texts and therefore hard to annotate. For the models based on $D_\\textrm {\\textit {HR}}$, we can find a large difference between the MAE for both stability and agreeableness. Agreeableness measures for example how kind and sympathetic a person is, which appears much more naturally in text compared to extraversion and conscientiousness. Stability, in particular low stability, can be displayed in writing as expressions of emotions like anger or fear, and these are often easy to identify."]}

The quality of annotations varies though, and is estimated from the self- and inter-annotator agreements. All the details about the datasets, the annotator agreements, and the ordering of sentiment values are in our previous study BIBREF22 .
